Thank you! Thank you so much. Thank you so much for being here. Me and my pants are very excited to see you. Let’s take stock of who’s here. Who here is a millennial like me?\\n[audience cheering]\\nYes! Yes. Expensive seats. Good for you. Comedy is all about specifics. So who here is an elder?\\nElder millennial! Yes!\\n[cheers and applause] And I like to have all different types of people in my audience. So who here is Generation X?\\n[audience cheering]\\nGood. Thank you. Thank you, Gen X, for MTV and… Back into obscurity you go. I believe in having a diverse audience. Who here is a baby boomer? [applause] One. Good. In the back, so he can rest when it’s dark. Good. And now for the delicious part. Who here is Generation Z? [audience cheering] They got one by himself. One by himself, not surrounded by friends. I’ve got you all alone. You don’t look so tough outside of a TikTok comments section. Well I have a message for you all to take back to your friends at your vape hive. Generation Z, you are not nice! Not nice to millennials specifically. And we have had it! And because your generation is a contextless one made up of soundbites and memes, you need to know a little bit about the generation who came before you. Millennials, yes, were here first!\\n[audience cheering]\\nYes! And we’ve had it rough. And we got out of school if we could afford it, and there were no houses and there were no jobs, and our parents said we had to stop eating avocados, and then we finally get old enough to where we’re having kids and buying houses. Just kidding. Still renting. And we got you coming up our fucking asses calling us problematic. But we did not create this mess of a society. Millennials did not start this fire. We literally don’t know how glamping was only cool for like a year. And you take out your anger on millennials because we are the only other ones in that TikTok comments section with you. But millennials are not to blame. You are angry. We’re not your parents. We are your older cousins who showed you how to smoke weed out of an apple.\\n[audience cheers]\\nYes! We are your bosses, who will give you the day off because your fee-fees are in retrograde. We get it. Also, we’re afraid of you. Be kind to millennials because you don’t know that we laid the groundwork for everything that makes you you. We had the ’90s first, you bitches!\\n[audience cheers]\\nYes! I remember the first time Birkenstocks were fucking ugly! I had them! We gave you everything. We laid the groundwork for the social media you make millions on. Never forget that millennials walked on Myspace. Yes! On Friendster! Yes! We walked three seconds at a time on Vine.\\nWe walked.\\n[audience cheers] We walked on Instagram, Gen Z, so you could run on TikTok. We gave you everything. So be kind to millennials because we are just as angry as you are, but our backs hurt and we have heartburn! [audience cheers] Yes. Back hurts a lot more now that I have two children.\\n[audience cheers]\\nYeah. I have two. I had a little boy. He’s eight months old. I had a little boy, and I always… I always like to tell audiences that I had a boy because I feel like it gets the men on my side right away. Men love to know, “Another one for the team.” They love to know there’s another boy in the world. They’re like, “One of us.” They love it. I’m like, I had a son. His penis is this big! And that’s when all the guys are like, “That’s still pretty big, statistically speaking!” “Even for an adult.” Had a little boy. Have a little girl. And I can honestly tell you, having been pregnant, that my least favorite part about being pregnant… Now, this is a long sentence, okay? So you feel free to jump on or off wherever you agree or disagree, okay? Having been pregnant twice, I can tell you my least favorite part about being pregnant is men… I always pause there. For the lesbians. That’s right.\\n[audience cheers]\\nThere they are. Oh, there’s a lot of you tonight. Good. They appreciate solid joke structure. They’re like, “That’s a good premise and punch line rolled into one. Continue.” The thing I like the least about being pregnant is men congratulating my husband on our pregnancy in front of me. I’m sorry, there’s just something a little weird about standing there fully pregnant while two men shake hands at the thought of fucking me. There’s just something… a little too Handmaid’s Tale about standing there incapacitated while two men congratulate each other on six seconds. “Well done.” There’s just something…\\n[audience cheers]\\nFive seconds? There’s just something a little too under his eye about the whole thing. Men love to know that if I’m not out there fucking, at least one of our own is out there doing the Lord’s work. They love it. Heterosexual men love to know that if they can’t be having sex, one of their brothers is out there having sex. They love to know other men are fucking. It is the gayest thing. They love to know. Oh, they get so jacked. “Oh, good to know you. Is that your wife? Hey, nice job.” “Me? I got four of my own. You bet I…” “You bet I fuck. You bet I do.” “You know it. Nothing better. Nothing better.” “Talking three, two, one, blastoff. Houston, we…” “I love it.” “Nothing better. Guy shit.” [imitating wolf howling] “Wolf pack. Guy stuff. Nothing better.” “Nothing better than blasting off in my wife, talking nothing better than ejaculating into a woman.” “Maybe…” “Maybe into a man. Only tried it once, and I gotta get back.” “Gotta get back into politics. Talking about guy stuff. Nothing better.” “Manly. Red, white and blue… [barks] is the color of my junk, and I got to get it checked out.” “But I don’t…” “I don’t trust the medical industrial complex, you know what I mean?” “Guy stuff, right now. You and me connecting like men.” “Get the women out of here. Us heterosexual men are a dying breed.” “Talking about shit only men care about. Don’t look here, motherfucker.” “I will goose you. Guy stuff, right now.” “Talking about shit only us men understand.” Wraparound reflective sunglasses. Things only men… That’s right, Utah. Things only men understand. Things only men do. Holding up a dead fish in your dating profile picture. Things only men do. Things only men do. Helping an absolute stranger back out of a parking space. Things only men do. Things only guys care about. Arguing about the accurate depiction of Vikings and fan art on Reddit. Things only men care about: Reddit. Things only guys… Arguing about Christopher Nolan movies. Talking about which Batman wore it best. Guy stuff. Think about things only men do. Push-ups in public and counting them. Guy stuff. Guy time. Things only men do. Becoming a personal injury attorney. Things only men do. Things only men struggle with. Maybe being a piece of shit your whole life, finding out you’re having a baby and that it’s a girl, and then, and only then, realizing women are people too. Things only men struggle with. Boys, I’m gonna let you know right up top. I want you in my audience. I am on your side. So I’m gonna give you the secret about women. We love you. We are obsessed with you. Not those six lesbians who laughed earlier, but we chemically, biologically, we cannot get enough of you. And we have so much time for your bullshit. Women get so dumb when we love a man. You would meet women that are like, “He’s going to prison for life, but I’m gonna wait.” Like we are so dumb. But the one thing no woman finds attractive is your late-in-life realization that half the population might also matter. The one thing no woman has time for is you and six of your gorilla friends sitting around a podcast recorder in your buddy’s ADU like you’re discovering fire, having these epiphanies like, “I’m gonna be honest wichu, bro. Always thought woman was not person.” “But then I has my baby girl, and that’s when I know, yo, woman is person too.” [grunts] Yeah! “Good job.” “Me.” “Her.” [grunts] Wearing Under Armour when you’re overweight. What is that boys? You’re not working out. You know, “running errands” is only an expression. You’re not actually doing cardio when you’re waiting in line for frozen yogurt in Gore-Tex, looking like you’re about to be launched into space. I have a little girl also, and…\\n[audience cheers]\\nThank you. Thank you. I’m the only woman to ever have a daughter, thank you. A little girl. She’s two and a half years old. I love her so much. I didn’t know it was possible to love something, someone, this much. I’m so beguiled by her. She’s so beautiful and sweet and pure and white. I just want to… [snorts and screams] Like, she’s so… Oh, come on. We’re not that far from Park City. Like, come on. You get that. [applause] I’m so in love with her. I’m so obsessed with her. And people are always asking, like, “Oh, are you gonna tell jokes?” “You have any jokes about your kids?” No. She’s two and a half years old. I don’t want to tell people things about her. Whenever you tell people about your kids, they’re gonna think that about your kids. I don’t share pictures of my children on the internet. I keep them to myself because whatever…\\n[cheers and applause]\\nWhat am I gonna do? Vent to you? “Oh, my God, my daughter was being a real bitch the other day.” And it’s a taping. Then for the rest of this little girl’s life, people are gonna be coming up to her like, “I heard you were a little monster bitch to your mama.” She doesn’t need that. She’s two and a half years old. She’s perfect. What am I gonna say? That she eats so much fruit, it’s an issue for our plumbing at home? Like what? She eats so much fruit when she takes a dump, it sounds like the opening of Law & Order. Like, “Ka-chung.” [humming Law & Order theme song] There’s been a homicide. I love her so much. I’m always kissing her. I can never get enough squeezes and hugs. You know this feeling if you have a beautiful baby or like a really thick cat. [growls] Cat’s just eating and you’re just like, “You!” The cat’s like, “Ah!” You have the secrets. The cat’s like, “I don’t have any secrets.” “You had too much coffee. Get your hands off of me.” I’m always kissing her, I’m always squeezing her, I’m always hugging her. And my daughter’s always avoiding me. And I’m always like, “Give me a hug.” She’s like, “Mom, I’m gonna call HR.” And I’m like, “Do it. I own the company.” [grunts] But I am. I can’t help it. I’m always squeezing her little tushy because it looks like two Hawaiian rolls, and I’m always biting her. Gentle biting, squeezing, hugging, and she’s always going over there. And I realize that I seek affection from my two-year-old daughter the same way the creepy guy in your office… seeks affection from women. I’m always like, “Sierra, where’s my hug?” “Where are you going, pretty girl?” “Can I have a smile? Can I have a smile?” “Smile for me. Can I have a kiss?” “No kiss. Why the fuck not?” “Why can’t I have a kiss?” “You’re in charge of Mommy’s emotional well-being.” “Give me a kiss. Give me a kiss. Give me a hug. Give me a fucking hug!” “Give me a hug.” “I won’t squeeze your tushy. I promise. I promise.” “I won’t– Just come here. I won’t.” “Just kidding!” Squeeze… the tushy. You have to. And I only share this very personal, very vulnerable part of my private life with you about squeezing tushy for, honestly, like any men in the audience who have been accused of sexual harassment, so…\\n[man in audience] Whoo!\\n[audience laughs]\\nI just want you to know I stand with you. Ah! I get it now. Uh, and as we conclude the requisite pregnancy portion of tonight’s stand-up, uh, I will tell you, well, that was a big thing that happened. I will tell you, I think the hardest part about being pregnant… well, honestly, is those last few hours. I mean, wow. I mean, it really takes it out of you, literally. Uh, I would say it’s right at the end. I would call it eight and a half months, right at the end where you’re not done, but you are done. And you can see the finish line, and you’re tired of it, and you’re– Fuck it, I hate to say it– bored. I know. It’s such an amazing, gorgeous… God. It’s boring! And you’re there, and you’re huge. And you don’t want to do anything. You want to be done with it. And it’s easy to do nothing. It’s easy to just sequester yourself in a dark room like a beached walrus just laying there like, “More fish!”\\n[audience laughs]\\nAnd I was so uncomfortable, and I was like, “Okay, I’m uncomfortable, but what do I still have control over?” “Just because I’m about to become someone else’s mother doesn’t mean I have to give up all of who I am.” “So what can I do at 2,000 pounds at eight and a half months pregnant?” “What can I do? Okay, well, I can still work out.” So I did that. I’m still gonna work out. I’m still gonna do stand-up, right? I’m still gonna drink. I’m not gonna like, “Oh…” Oh, I can’t have a daiquiri because, like, you need eyes? Like, “Uh…” right? Check your privilege. Check your fucking ocular privilege. No, you shouldn’t drink when you’re pregnant. Well… I’m not a doctor. I’m not not a doctor. Are you like me, where you feel if there were no medical personnel in an emergency, you would be someone’s next best bet because you paid a lot of attention to ER reruns. Like, I feel like… No, I’m not a doctor, but I will say, and I’m pretty sure most medical personnel would agree with this, at eight and a half months pregnant, if you have a healthy baby and you’re healthy and you’ve done everything right and you want to have half a beer to feel like a fucking human, you can have half a beer. Okay? You can have a beer. Nothing’s happening at eight and a half months that was so important it didn’t get done already, okay? I don’t know what you’re waiting for. At eight and a half months, all that kid is doing is learning to take advantage of your generous hospitality. At eight and a half months, you’re like, “Get out of there.” The kid’s like, “Fuck you, Mom. Squatters rights.” He’s just in there… smoking weed, listening to Rush. He’s not doing anything. Eight and a half months, nothing’s happening, okay? I promise you, at eight and a half months, like… Like, if your kid doesn’t have hands at eight and a half months… he ain’t getting hands. That’s the punch line. I don’t know what you’re waiting on. They’re not like fruit, where it’s the last thing to grow on the tree, like… I think people really underestimate a lot about genetics and science and pure luck. At eight and a half months, you’ve done all you can do. It doesn’t matter all your good thoughts, or how many essential oils you eat or sell. This feels like that kind of city. Uh…\\n[audience cheers]\\nIt doesn’t matter. Conversely, there are plenty of people who are born early. And they’re totally fine. There is a lot of luck involved. There are plenty of people who are born prematurely and they’re doing great. Who here was born early and you’re doing okay? Raise your hands.\\nRaise your hands if you were born early.\\n[applause]\\nCan’t see your hands because they’re so small.\\nBut you get the…\\n[audience laughs]\\nGotcha. You think twice before participating next time with your tiny little baby hands. [whimpers] And I will tell you, for me, one of the scariest parts about having a child, besides being in charge of a life, is what it did to me mentally. When you have a baby, as a woman, you become… How do I put this scientifically? Um, fucking dumb. Now, you were reserved in your laughter. You were reticent to laugh because we’re not supposed to make fun of mothers. Who here’s a mother? Raise your hand. Yeah.\\n[audience cheers]\\nThere you go. Bunch of idiots right here. They understand what it’s like when you have a baby. They call it mom brain, right? They call it moo mind. You don’t know what’s going on and it’s not your fault. I’m here to tell you it’s not because you’re selfish or myopic. It is because when you have a baby, your brain shrinks. Your brain medically, chemically, biologically shrinks. It’s not a part of your brain that you were gonna use. It’s just a part of your brain that you needed to remember how to operate a motor vehicle, remember dates, names, times, places, what a turn signal is. That part is gone. Just so you know, it’s the reason your mom sounds like a mom. Her brain has shrunken. I’m sorry. It’s the reason your mom confuses you and your brother’s name. It’s the reason your mom can’t remember. And it’s the reason she doesn’t know lyrics to songs. It’s the reason my mother once referred to John Krasinski as, “Oh, who’s that Polish actor I love?” She’s operating at half capacity. I feel like women are cackling at this and men are like, “There’s no way. We’d better ask Joe Rogan.” “There’s no way.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“There’s no way she knows a brain fact.” “There’s no way she has access to brain facts about her own brain.” ‘Tis true. Your brain shrinks, and it’s not for nothing. Your brain shrinks to make way for a part of your brain that actually gets larger, and that is the part that knows how to reflexively care for a child. Those are your mama bear instincts. That’s the eyes in the back of your head. That part is, engorge, but that part is what you need to know how to anticipate the needs of a child. For example, my daughter will never fall. Not on my watch! She’s not falling. She could be in the other room and I’m in the kitchen doing dishes, and I’ll be like, “Gravitational shift. She’s falling!” [exhaling rapidly] Ah. Ah, I gotcha. I gotcha. [exhales]\\n[audience cheers]\\nWhat was your name? Who are you? And I will tell you honestly, it’s very scary to have that mom brain because I’m a comedian. I speak for a living. I cannot come out here and deliver half of a punch line. You came here for a show. I can’t come out and be like, “I was gonna say something and I forgot.” “I forgot.” And it’s scary because not only do you forget stuff, but there’s a softening. You’re this mom and you’re a warrior, and you would do anything to protect your kid. But the rest of the time, you are the soft underbelly of a hamster. The rest of the time, your sense of humor gets weird. I can’t have that. I can’t be on a podcast with a bunch of comics, and they’re all chopping it up, getting new fans, zingers, and they’re all funny, and I’m sitting there like, “I was gonna make a joke, but then I got scared, and…” “I saw this video. Look, it’s a mouse wearing a strawberry for a hat.” “I hope he gets home safe, but his Tinder…” “Double tap. How do I log into my email?” It’s scary and it’s sad because you start laughing at things that aren’t funny, right? And I don’t mean like someone falling down the stairs. I mean, like, “Look, there’s me. A raccoon fell into a pumpkin.” “And now what’s he gonna do? It’s the holidays.” It’s scary. It’s scary and it’s embarrassing to laugh at things that aren’t funny or that are hacky. Period, new paragraph, indention. My husband and I were taking a shower the other day, and…\\n[audience whoops]\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you. Just wanted to let you know we’re doing well. We own a shower. I misspoke. I was taking a shower. My husband was shivering in the corner of the shower.\\n[audience cheers]\\n“When will it be my turn?” You keep following us in there, boys, we’re gonna do that to you every time. Gonna get relegated to shower Siberia every time. That’s what you get. I’m trying to take a shower, and your husband’s always like, “Oh, can I come in?” You’re like, “Sure, this will be different than every other time.” “Come on in.” Six years of marriage later, it’s totally gonna be different. Come on in. He’s like, “Here I come.” You’re like, “Okay, are you in? Good.” “Will you shut the shower door? Are you in? Are you a little damp? Good.” “My cousin is such a bitch!”\\n[audience laughs]\\nHe’s just in the corner. What do you think is gonna happen? That we’re gonna have shower sex over 40? What? Even in your 30s– No one over 25 is attempting or having shower sex. Why? Why do you want that? You’re so horny you can’t walk ten feet to the bed? Fifteen in a big house. Like, you can’t put some carpet down? You can’t make it. Who would want this? What man, if, given his druthers for fantasy sex, has ever been like, “Okay, first, I need a wet piece of granite and I’m gonna stand on it.” “I need slick marble that I can balance on, simultaneously pulling both Achilles, and I want to hold up another human as I balance while she complains that she feels ugly and she’s cold.” “This is what gets me going.”\\n[audience cheers]\\nAll the lube to get washed away while lauryl sulfate just drips into my eyes. This is how I like to fuck. Why… No couple has ever left the shower after shower sex and both of them be like, “Wow, we were both totally comfortable and warm the whole time.” “That was outstanding.” So it was my husband’s turn at the water. Only because I had a hair mask. I was like, “You got two minutes.” It’s like a prison shower. He’s like, “Yes, right away.” Speaking of my husband, washing his body, he dropped… the soap.\\n[audience laughs and cheers]\\nOkay, so you’re laughing at that. It’s a hacky joke. I don’t mean to shame you, but it’s a hacky joke. And as a comic, I know better. I laughed so fucking hard. And my husband judged me and shamed me. He was like, “Really?” “You’re laughing at a ‘don’t drop the soap’ joke?” I thought about it. I got back in the warm water and I thought about it… for 45 minutes. I… No, we don’t waste water. Uh, I thought about it. [clears throat] The “don’t drop the soap” joke is the last remaining vestige of homophobic comedy that we, as a nation, have just decided we’re gonna go ahead and keep. We have come so far in terms of understanding sexuality as a spectrum. People have pronouns, LGBTQIA, we added LMNOP. It’s inclusive, we get it. Gay flag is everywhere, right on. But someone somewhere drops a bar of soap, and we are the first ones to be like, “Don’t drop the soap!”\\n[audience applauds]\\nYou drop it… Yeah. Yeah, or someone’s gonna fuck you in the asshole… in your own home. Love of my life. Follow us into that shower. Guys do not care. They do not care. It doesn’t matter how you’re feeling as a woman, because guys don’t give a fuck what you look like. You could be– “I’m so– I have COVID in my butt and in my mouth.” “And it’s just–” “And I have hand, foot and mouth, and I just…” “Oops, oops, my leg fell off.” “I guess I’ll just…” “Okay, I don’t feel well. I’ll just get the shower.” Your husband’s like, “Oh good, you can’t fight me off.” And they will just follow you in. You’re like, “I don’t know. My body feels so gross.” “I just had this baby.” He’s like, “Another one won’t kill you.” “Here we go.” They don’t care. They will chase you in there. And it makes you realize just how little a woman actually has to do to turn a man on.\\n[audience cheers]\\nThat’s right. All the women cheering for that are my age or older. All the girls in their 20s are like, “I don’t understand.” [in elderly voice] Let me tell you. [in normal voice] Once you understand that for the average man, the bar is set so low the limit does not exist. Girls, you are going to save so much money at Sephora. And you are going to spend so much less money on therapy. Once you understand that for the average guy, they don’t care. Think of all the times, girls, you have done the most hair, makeup, skin, nails, feet. And he showed up in flip-flops! Think… of all the times you’ve gotten ready and you’ve looked perfect. And on the way out, you’re like, “Oh, my God, I’ve got armpit stubble.” “Oh, my God, I’d better dry-shave it in the hallway!” What, now you’re on a date with fire pits? Like, “Hi, Ryan.” Like, he’s gonna… You think he would put himself through that for the date? No, he doesn’t care. He didn’t get ready for that date. Homeboy picked you up for your date in a Saturn. I know. I heard some boos. Some guys don’t like that joke. I know. I see you. I see your little obstinate arm crossed. They’re like, “Okay, Saturn. It was a classic.” “That Saturn Vue was a limited edition.” “It had a digital ashtray,” And this is where all the women will say, “But we have to do these things.” “It’s Western standards.” “We’re forced to participate in these systems.” “It’s the patriarchy.” Girls, we have to stop saying “patriarchy.” It’s dated, it’s annoying. And I’m gonna tell you why we have to stop saying “patriarchy.” You’ve literally never heard a woman say the word “patriarchy” and thought to yourself, “Oh, I can’t wait to hear what else she has to say.” So… we need better language. Some men are good men. It’s not the patriarchy. It’s bigger than that, sister. I got news for you. It’s the world. It’s the internet. Wanting women to feel bad about themselves so someone can sell you cheap hyaluronic acid in a gallon of water and bad plastic. It’s the internet operating on a currency of female insecurities. If people can make you feel bad about the way that you are naturally, then they can serve you targeted ads, and you will buy garbage. That’s what the internet wants: to sell you lotion, body cream, fucking glitter, lip gloss for your asshole. They want to just sell you… That was a joke, but it is a great idea.\\n[audience laughs and cheers]\\nButthole lip gloss. We call it “blip gloss.” Like, I… I’m gonna be the first to market. I’m gonna be like, “Hey, Sharks, do I have an idea for you.”\\n[audience cheers]\\n“I’m here seeking a 30% stake in my company.” “Lip gloss for your asshole.” I would be sealing everything with a kiss. Everything. Holiday cards. Birthday cards. Housewarming cards. New Year’s Eve. Everything. And people would be like, “Oh, my God, is this scratch and sniff?” I’d be like, “Try it.” I would be… And they would. They’d be like, “Is that strawberry?” I’d be like, “It probably was.” The internet wants you to believe that you are not good enough so that you can feel bad about yourself, and then a lesser type of guy has a shot at you. That’s the whole fucking scam. The internet would have you believe you’re not enough, and that you’re not worthy, and that a real man wants a woman who’s nervous, no opinions of her own. Flatfoot, barefoot in a kitchen, referring to her husband as “my king.” This might not have been the right city to tell that joke in. But still, the internet…\\n[audience cheers]\\nThe internet lies. Go out in the real world, girls. Real men are not afraid of real women. That’s the God’s honest truth. There you go. Real men like a woman with a little bit of thigh meat and an education. I promise you. Yeah. It could even be like a communications degree. Just something that shows… that you went. My heroes are the women that laugh at that joke, even though it hurts. Those are my heroes, the women that are like, “I don’t even remember what I studied.” “I’m in so much debt.” This is not about being mean to men. This is about empowering women, and this is about us as women realizing how much you have denied yourself because of this puritanical view of what a woman should be. All the times you wanted to eat that extra wing, or wear that bikini even though you felt thick, or go out without shaving your legs, think of all the uninhibited monkey sex we could be having, girls…\\n[audience cheers]\\n…if we weren’t beholden to this biblically steeped version of what a woman is. Think of all the fun we could be having. Think of all the times you’ve looked great and you’re like, “No.” And your partner’s like, “Let’s have sex in the shower.” And you’re like, “No, I feel so gross.” “I’m so gross, I’m so gross and sweaty because I went outside.” “I’m a monster. Oh, my God, I’m so sweaty.” “Isn’t it disgusting that I have a functioning endocrine system?” “I know. I should keep it in. I’m sorr–” Your partner doesn’t care. You’re like, “I’m disgusting.” He’s like, “Sit on my face! I will Venmo you!” They don’t care.\\n[audience cheers]\\nHe’s like, “It’s true. Do it right now.” They don’t care. “No, I’m so greasy and bloated because I fed myself dinner.” “No, I’m so disgusting.” And he’s just like, “Jesus Christ, Jessica, shit on my chest!” “I will Cash App you.” They don’t care. Guys don’t care. And I wish I knew how little they cared in my 20s, because I wouldn’t have flat ironed my hair so much. I don’t… No man has ever been like, “Yeah, but can you make it straighter?” Like… “I want to make out with Tom Petty.” Like, I would never… Especially men in their 20s. Like, a 25-year-old guy would have sex with a warmed-up bag of pudding… between two couch cushions.\\n[audience laughs and cheers]\\nI do have to say, I wrote that joke a year before anyone knew who JD Vance was. And I also want to say, the only reason every man in this room is not laughing, I think, is because they’re all still thinking like… “I never thought about warming it up before.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Whoa.” There’s always a couple of old-timers: “Don’t put it in the microwave too long. You burn your pee-pee.” We do all of these things. We jump over all these hurdles to be attractive. And the sad, God’s honest truth is that when a man first likes a woman, it actually has nothing to do with her. When a guy first sees a girl, he looks at her with his reptilian brain and he just thinks for a second, he sees her and he scans her real quick. He’s like, “Okay, is she symmetrical? No, but I’m a six, so that’s fine.” This happens in a matter of seconds, milliseconds. He’s like, “But she smells like vanilla and reminds me of my mom, hello!” Okay, and they will… And if they’re into it, if they chemically are attracted to you, he will approach you. He will set down his McRib and he will come… and talk to you. When a guy first sees a girl, it has nothing to do with the girl. That’s not to take away from us as beautiful creatures, girls. And then you guys get to know each other, and then your personality, girls, ruins the rest of it. That’s right, but at the beginning… When a guy likes a girl, he can’t help it. And it’s unfortunate, and I can prove it. Because every single woman in this room at some point in her life has had a guy who’s just decided he likes you, now it’s your fucking problem. Every woman in this room at some point has had some lunatic that’s like, “We’re meant to be together!” “Christine!” [growls] And you’re like, “Okay, my name is Leslie. Here’s your Starbucks.” Like, every girl has to deal with that. Every girl has had the guy that’s like, “What? She looked at me, so I followed her home… Your Honor.” Some guys don’t like that joke. I know. It’s usually the same guys who didn’t laugh at my Saturn punch line. I see you. See your little beady eyes are like, “Okay, okay. Counterpoint.” “Counterpoint. If she didn’t like me, why’d she take my money?” It’s like, “Sir, she’s a tollbooth worker.” I know. The laugh is a little thin on that. I think I lose some of our Gen Z with the reference. I want to bring you in. So Gen Z, go home, ask your parents what a worker is.\\n[audience laughs and cheers]\\nThey’re just jokes, folks. The whole point of being in a relationship is to grow as an individual and build something with someone else. And for women, we cannot be in a relationship unless we feel loved. And we cannot feel loved unless we feel safe. That is paramount, okay? So in order to feel loved, girls, you got to find someone. You want true love. You want to build something with someone. So, girls, I advise that you go out and you find someone in this world who loves you a little bit more than you love them. Do not look at your date right now. Don’t tap them. Don’t– Just stay right here, locked on me. You look at him right now, it’s gonna be a real long drive back to Provo. So you just stay looking right here. I got you. We’ll just skip right over that joke and move on. But it’s a beautiful thing when a woman feels loved and a woman feels safe, then she can truly blossom. I hate that word. But then she can truly become herself. And it’s only when a woman is loved and feels safe that a magical change occurs. It’s only when we know that we are loved by you, truly loved, that we can begin to get uglier! Yes! Yes! [growls] That was the plan all along. Big pants. To squirrel up into your heart and grow a mustache! That’s what we wanted. Yes! Mud masks around the house. Yes, that was the idea. There’s no point in getting hotter once you’re in a relationship. There’s no ROI. Who cares? Who’s getting married 30 years later? Like, “You know what? It’s time to kick it up a notch.” For what? You’re good. At my 50-year anniversary, I want my husband and I to just not even be two people. I want us to just be one giant cat turd. And I want… laying there. “Happy anniversary. Let’s eat chicken pickles, and then… we can have sex while we check our phones, and then… we can fall asleep watching The Office, with that Polish actor.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n[blows raspberry] There is a, uh… there is something interesting that happens, and I’m experiencing this as I’m getting older. And often it coincides with being married or in a long-term relationship. But as women, this idea that we stop caring is silly, okay? You always want to look your best, and we always try our best. But as you get older, it’s not that you stop caring, it’s that you stop caring as much about what other people think.\\nAnd when it comes to…\\n[audience cheers] …empowerment or dressing sexy, your barometer sort of changes and you start to dress a little bit more for yourself as we get older, right? As we age as women, or if you’re in a long relationship, you sort of stop looking for external validation from men because you’re getting it in this relationship or from yourself, right? As we get older, as women, we stop dressing for the male gaze. “Gaze,” spelled G-A-Z-E. Not the male gays, honey. We are always dressing for them. They did this okay?\\n[audience cheers]\\nYeah. They’re always in our hearts. But no couple who’s been married a while is coming out of a dressing room and she’s like, “Look babe, it’s a bikini that cuts my turkey meat and half so it hangs out the bottom.” “And then… it’s a belly chain with a thong that I’m gonna wear backward.” “I call it a split decision.” Don’t forget the blip gloss. No, when you’re married, you’re coming out of that dressing room like, “Look, baby, they’re khakis that taper… with the matching vest and the hat.” “I’m a dandy bear.” And your husband, if he knows what’s good for him, will support it. He’ll just be like, “You look– You’re my queen.” “Oh, God.” You’re like, “I cut my hair really short.” He’s like, “You’re an empowered…” [grunts and groans] Now, these are just jokes. Of course, every woman wants to look her best. Every person wants to look their best. We still try. Girls, you still got to try, right? You still got to wipe, right?\\nYou still got to…\\n[audience laughs]\\nThere’s always a couple of guys that are like, “No, you don’t.” Always want to try. For your own self-worth, for yourself, for your partner. I’m sure your job wouldn’t mind if you ran a comb through that mop. You always want to try. But the ask is never that women look perfect. Let’s be clear about this, that’s not what they’re asking because there is no such thing as perfection. There is no “they’re” there. The ask is that we as women spend all of our mental bandwidth, money and free time trying to attain a bullshit level of perfection. And while we are busy not only trying to look perfect, but justify our existence, justify why you want kids, why you don’t want kids, why you want to shatter a glass ceiling, justifying your artistic integrity, explaining to everyone what it’s like to balance it all while you were busy fighting with other women over who breastfed best or who’s the baddest bitch of them all. While we were busy fighting each other and trying to be perfect, they were what? Taking away our rights to our bodies. That’s what was happening while we were obsessed with bullshit. While we were sleeping with a red light on. Because the ask is always that women be beautiful. But we don’t ask the same of men. We always ask that the woman be structurally perfect, stunning, snatch. We don’t care what she’s married to. She could be beautiful, and she can be married to a bowl of soup, and nobody questions it. Again, do not look at your date. Just look at me. I always see women poking, like, “You’re chicken noodle. That’s you.” In a relationship, the ask is always that the woman tries the hardest, keeps it tight, snatched, perfect. And the guy could just be a fucking onion, and nobody cares. Nobody cares. In fact, as a society, we prefer it that way. We’re very comfortable with women trying the hardest and the guy just being a lint trap. We walk by and we’re just like, “Oh, that’s the way the Lord intended a man and a woman to look.” “She, a goddess.” “Him, gum.” This is what we like. And you never see it the other way. And when you do, people get angry about it, right? When you see a good-looking guy with perhaps a less attractive woman. If you open a tabloid, you see like a male movie star, and he’s just married to like a civilian. It’s a picture of a guy who’s jacked professionally on a vacation with his 38-year-old wife mothering their three kids. She’s got no makeup on. People are like, “Oh, maybe she’s sick.” “How good of him to stay with her, even though she’s not wearing any bronzer.” And I was like, “Well, why is it that way?”\\nSurely, it’s just a coastal thing, right? I live in LA, and you go to New York, and this is the expectation, that women are structurally stunning, perfect, and it doesn’t matter what she’s married to. I’m like, maybe it’s just a coastal thing. Where can you go where it’s maybe normalized? I want to see normal people. Where do you go where maybe yeah, the guy is rugged from working out and building a barn for Christ? I don’t know, just putting up… It feels like Middle America. You guys– That’s your family. I feel like… Where can you go where maybe the men are a little bit rugged, salt of the earth, and the women are a little bit homely or comely? The answer is the Midwest. I don’t know why I have to like, parse this out. When I’m in the Midwest, I say the South. Anywhere, you’re gonna see a disparity in looks any time you are outside of a major city, okay? When people get married young. When people get married young, you don’t really know what your spouse is gonna grow up to look like. When you get married older, like I did, you get married at like 36? My husband and I, I knew his back hair was going somewhere and he knew I needed Invisalign. Like, we knew. We knew that– You get married at, like, 19. That’s a genetic fucking grab bag, my friends. You don’t know how her tooth is gonna come in, what his hair is gonna do. You don’t know. Period. Indention. New paragraph. I was in an airport in rural Kansas, going to a gig in the middle of nowhere. This is not that long ago. So I’m pregnant. I’m standing there in this small regional airport, and a man walked into this airport, folks, who was so masculine… I just heard a giggle. Talk about repressed sexuality. I’m like, “He was manly.” She’s like… [chuckles evilly] Let it out.\\nHe was so masculine. I didn’t know they made men like this outside of like an HGTV home renovation show. Like he was… I walked up him like, I was like “Are you the president of Magnolia Network?” Like, he was… like an oak. Just structurally stunning, masculine, dripping with masculinity. It did things to me. Like, I needed him. I needed him to need me to need him to need me. I just wanted to be at his feet. He was so manly, he walked in and I just wanted him to help me do anything. I was like, “Please, we have no food for the winter.” “Please help my village.” You are attracted to this, okay? I don’t care what you brought here tonight or what your Tinder profile is set to, it’s this, genetically. Someone in your family fucked something that looked like that, and it’s the only reason your genetics survived till today. He was stunning, okay? I will describe him to you. Giggles over there was like, “Yes, finally.” [shudders] The women are excited because you don’t have church till tomorrow. They’re like, “Get it in now.” [giggles nervously] All the men are like, “Is it too early to pull the truck around?” Okay, first of all, let’s get this out of the way. Boys, yes, he was tall, okay? Not trying to hurt your feelings. I know you’re real sensitive about height. I know you get upset when women make fun of you for your height. And I just want you to know that we do it on purpose.\\n[audience laughs]\\nYou can’t control it. And to be fair, you make fun of us for everything! And so take it on the chin. You’re so sensitive about it, you got women out here calling you short kings. That’s bullshit, okay? You’re a short subject. That’s it. You’re short. It’s fine. We need to hold your hand about it. I wouldn’t mind calling you a king if you extended the same royal courtesy to us. But you make fun of women for everything, and I never hear a guy say, “Oh, she’s a fat princess.” I never hear a guy… “Oh, she’s an unemployed duchess.” I never hear a guy who’s like, “Oh, she can’t have kids. She’s a baroness.” I never hear…\\n[audience laughs]\\n…that. But, gentlemen, at the beginning I said I was on your side. I do think sometimes women make too big of a deal out of the height thing. You get girls that are like, “He’d better be 6’9” with a ten-digit bank account and a 12-foot wingspan. You’re like, “Are you an NBA scout?” Like, what are these…? “You’d better have a ten-digit bank account.” I’m like, “You work at the mall, so let’s just relax.” How tall do you want it? You can’t be attracted to this. The Slavic basketball players clocking in at 8’13” with enlarged hearts. You can’t be… You’re looking at that like, “What is that penis? Just…”\\n[audience cheers]\\nLike, at that height, at seven feet tall, what is a hand job? Just wrapping cable? Like… Let’s go, Vlad. [humming “Man! I Feel Like a Woman!”] He was tall. Okay. Nice head of hair. Not gonna act like that’s not a plus. His forehead, though, was strong. How do you get a strong forehead? How do you work out a forehead? Probably from bashing in car windows to save kittens. Bam, bam, bam! Thick. It was a ridge of a forehead. You could build a settlement on it. Like, it was just… And it exacerbated how blue his eyes were because the built-in skin and bone visor that he had, you could see just laser blue eyes. I have blue eyes. Something like 2% of people on this planet have blue eyes. So my blue eyes saw his blue eyes and I was like, “I want to fuck my distant cousin.” This is exquisite. But the part I’ll miss the most… his jaw. Easy, Utah. Some woman fainted over there. Oh! Enjoy it. His jaw was, in a word, structured. Okay? Muscular, strong, clear definition between church and state. All right, boys? We know what you’re doing when you grow a swath of hair there. You’re like, “Oh, maybe she won’t know that it’s all connected.” We know. “Oh, maybe she’ll just fall in love with my dedication to my cats and first-person shooter games.” No, we know what you’re doing. Jaw was strong, girls. Strong. So you know it wouldn’t get tired. Strong.\\n[audience cheers]\\nYeah. There you go. I love that you’re cheering for that. You’re like, “Utah is the go-down-on-me state.”\\n[audience cheers]\\nThere you go. But it is a mostly female cheer on that joke. And I want to just take a second to talk to the men in my audience, because at the beginning I said I’m on your side, and I’m glad you’re here. Gentlemen, I want you to know stand-up comedy is for you as well, okay? I really believe that the types of men who come to see an Iliza Shlesinger show have impeccable taste in comedy. And I believe that the kind of men who have been supporting me my whole career see me as a comedian, not a female comedian. And I believe that you appreciate the art that I make. And I also think that you enjoy the glimpse into the way that women’s minds work. And I think that you’re sweet men, and I love having you in my crowd. And I really feel like I make my joke, I’m like, “His jaw was strong, so you know it wouldn’t get tired.” And I genuinely feel, boys, that you’re, like, “Tired from what?”\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience laughs]\\nThat’s most of you. I appreciate that. There’s always one or 2% of guys who got dragged here because they bought me as an early Christmas present for their girlfriend and they’re sitting there like, “Jesus Christ, I’m tired.” “Tired from what? Explaining everything to you women?” “Once again, Christopher Nolan is a god.” [groans] Nolan! Nolan! Okay… Tall, masculine. Body was so masculine, it wasn’t even a man’s body. That’s how manly it was. It wasn’t even a body. It was just the chassis of an F-250. And the last thing I remember before I passed out… was that he had the perfect amount of chest hair.\\n[woman whoops]\\n[chuckles] Someone get her some water. Now there is… there is a perfect amount, mind you, okay? Because it was cropping out from under his flannel. Working man’s tartan. And it was cropping out. There is a perfect amount of chest hair. Now, I’m going to set up a joke, but in the setup of that joke, I’m going to use a word that in and of itself is not a bad word, but because of the heightened sense of hysteria on social media, that word will feel charged. And you will hear that word, you won’t know why, but you will reflexively bristle and you will turn on me. You will. But then I’m going to give you the punch line, and then you’re going to be like, “Oh, we were always safe with her.” “Why did we… so viciously turn on her almost an hour in, after we’ve been enjoying?” You don’t want too much chest hair, okay? You don’t want it to be too ethnic. I didn’t say which ethnicity. So that’s on you racist motherfuckers. Whoever you’re thinking about. It’s Persian. Uh, no, you don’t want…\\n[audience laughs]\\nI know, all the Asian guys are like, “Whew!” No one wants too much chest hair. When a woman lays her head down on the hairy chest of a man or a woman… [mumbles] …you want just enough chest hair that it feels like a furry Tempur-Pedic, and it cradles… your cervical spine, right in that C4. This is what you want, C5. You don’t want too much chest hair because you don’t want to sink into it like… Okay? We can all agree. So we’re in the airport, we’re talking. I’m sitting on his lap. We’re just sort of getting to know… What? It’s a small airport. I told you that. I set it up at the beginning. No, we were just talking, and he was– He was so good-looking. You ever talk to someone who’s so genetically superior, you just create a whole future for the two of you just in your head? Like, he was talking to me and the whole time, I’m just like, “Maybe we could make it work.” Like, I’m sure if my family saw you… You ever talk to someone who’s so good-looking, you forget how to speak? Male or female. Like, he was so handsome, at one point I was like, “I’m gonna go to the water closet.” The what? [in British accent] I’m going to the water closet. [in normal voice] Why would you say that? No, I’m gonna go to the bathroom. Did you want anything? What? Why? From the bathroom? “Oh, here’s a bouquet of tampons, my love.” Like, what are you fucking? Stupid girl. Idiot. Now he’s never gonna ask us to winter formal. No, we were just standing there. Uh, and I noticed that he had a wedding ring. And so I was like, “Oh, where’s your wife?” Dead, I hope, for us.\\nNo, I saw he had a wedding ring, and quite frankly, I got excited, right? Women like to look at other women, and I knew that she was gonna be beautiful based on what we talked about earlier. I thought, “If he’s this good-looking, she’s gonna be stunning.” Women like to look at other women so that we may steal. And I wanted to… I was so excited to see her because he’s this beautiful, she has to be so exponentially much more stunning, right? She’s gonna be beautiful, right? Right? Wrong! Because they got married at, like, 17. One of these couples that’s been married for 50 years, but they’re only 35. She was a gargoyle. She came running in swinging a Stanley at me. [grunting] [yells] I was like, “Easy, easy.” She was kicking at me. Charms flying off her Crocs. [yelling] I was like, “It’s okay. It’s okay.” This poor woman’s probably been fighting off women her whole life from talking to her hot-as-fuck husband. [yelling] I was like, “It’s okay. It’s okay.” [shushing] Smell, smell, smell. Smell. There you go. It’s okay. Yeah. Yeah, it’s Britney Spears. I know. I’m 41. It’s okay. It’s okay. That’s okay, come over here. Come over here. You’re a pretty girl. No woman had ever been nice to her like that, and I’m a girl’s girl. It’s okay, pretty girl. [yells] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. She was charging at me. No. Sit down. [grunting and growling] No, no, no, no! That’s a pretty bracelet. That’s a pretty bracelet. Where’d you get it? Where’d you get the pretty bracelet? [snarls]\\n[audience laughs]\\n[snarls] She was trying to tell me something. She started rearing up like she was gonna declare something. [groaning] I was like, “You can tell me. It’s okay. You can share where you got it with me.” [grunting and snarling] Hey? Hobby Lobby. [snarling] Pretty girl. [audience cheering] And the last thing I have for you this evening is a hill that I am prepared to die on.\\n[audience whoops and cheers]\\nNo woman… wants to be a bitch… at first. No woman wants to be a bitch. Women become bitches because of systemic societal oppression bullshit and you not listening to me, Steve! But no woman… wants… to be a bitch. What we wanted was equity. What we wanted was safety. What we wanted was fair pay. And instead they put lead in our tampons and they took our pockets!\\n[audience cheers]\\nWe wanted to be heard. You made us this way. No woman wants to be a bitch. No woman wakes up and sets her morning intention to bitch. No girl, when she’s little, is like, “When I grow up, I’m gonna be a liability.” No woman… wants to be a bitch. Never forget, women are special. We are sacred. There is something so magical about us. And that is why people get violent and mean and horrific when they cannot own a woman. Because everybody wants a woman. Everybody wants to fuck a woman, be a woman, have a woman, appropriate the way a woman is, dress like a woman, have a mother, have a sister. You ever meet a man that has no women in his life? He’s weird. Everyone wants a woman. If you wanted mercy or empathy or softness, you would go to a woman. Women are maternal, and there’s something very magical about that. And you can be maternal without actually being a mother to a human child. And by the way, if you don’t want to be a mother to a child, I will always respect your right and always fight for your right to make that choice for yourself.\\n[audience cheers]\\nWe, as women, love to take care of things. A baby, a partner, a problem, a society, a community. That little fat cat we were talking about earlier. We want to take care of things. Women see a bunny, and your first thought, girls, is always, “Oh!” “Do baby need a mommy?” Even if that baby has a mommy, you’re like, “Take that mommy away.” “Eat that mommy, give me the baby.” Women, we will be walking our dog and you’ll see another dog very happy, well taken care of with its owner, and your first thought is always like, “I could take better care of that dog.” Like we just… The only time my faith in my ability to take care of my rescue dog is shaken is when I run into lesbians who foster dogs. It’s like the boss of the level. Lesbians who foster dogs will approach your pet in a way you did not know you could walk up to an animal. They get right in and they’re like, “Who’s this angel?” And the dog’s like, “Linda, it’s you!” And you’re just like… “You guys know each other?” “Yeah, from the convention!” Like… Lesbians who foster dogs will ask you very simple questions about your animal. But it feels like a government interrogation. It feels like you’re flying back into the country. Like, “Do I have black tar heroin on me?” I don’t fucking know. “What kind of food you feeding this angel?” You’re like, “Just mostly soup. I don’t know.” It feels like you’re talking to Child Protective Services. You’re just like, “Oh, she has a key. She comes and goes.” Women see the bunny, the baby need the mommy. Men are wired differently, and that’s okay. Men are more aggressive. They are hunters, providers. Men see the bunny, and their first thought is, “Bam!” Get off my lawn. And get on this key chain. Remember the ’90s? That was so fucked up. Why is no one talking about that? You’re eight years old, you’re like, “I’ll take bubble gum and a sticker, and if I could get a dismembered rabbit foot, hollowed out, dyed purple so I can wear it on my belt like a village medicine woman, that would be totally normal for a child.” The baby need the mommy. But no woman wants to be a bitch. And what is so, I guess, weird for me as I deliver this piece of art to you is that I am keenly aware, as I posit the statement, “No woman wants to be a bitch.” I’m keenly aware of the fact not so much that I’m old, right? Because that’s subjective and relative, but that I am getting older, which is absolute. I started doing comedy at 21. I’ve been playing Utah since your ABV levels were low. Okay?\\n[audience cheers]\\nPlaying Utah since you had weird beer, okay? I started doing comedy at 21, talking about vodka sodas and party goblins and hand jobs. Yes! And I still am talking about hand jobs. But that hand now has retinol on it. What I’m keenly aware of as I deliver these words to you, I say unto you, “No woman wants to be a bitch.” I posit this thesis. I buttress it with arguments and science and act-outs and intelligence. And I am aware that this will get fed into the internet and it will pop out just stitched next to some influencer who’s 23. I’m like, “No woman wants to be a bitch.” “Actually, I love being a bitch, deadass, no cap.” “I love…”\\n[audience cheering]\\n“I love being– I’m 23 and I’m a Virgo, so that means something to one out of every 12 people.” “I love…” “I do young-girl things like not wear sunscreen and have sex with my eyes open.” I only say that at the end of the program, just to rip the audience right in half! Any girls who are, like, under 35 or not married, you’re like, “Why wouldn’t you keep them open to behold the Adonis undulating atop you or beside you in the shower?” “It’s amazing.” And those of us who are over 40 or married, we’re just like, “You just keep them closed!”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“And think about the guy from the Kansas airport.”\\nSalt Lake City, I love you. Thank you.\\n[electronic music playing]\\n[cheering and applause]\\n[electronic music continuous]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nIliza Shlesinger, Stand-up transcripts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Comment Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

What a perfect place to do this.\\nMy boys have been exploring it, you know, during the day when nothing\\u2019s going on here.\\nThat third balcony is way the heck up there.\\nThat\\u2019s literally the nosebleed section. It\\u2019s awesome.\\nThey were running around, and James discovered something today that I thought was pretty great. So, he\\u2019s running around.\\nAnd because it\\u2019s the Pabst Theater, he found the \\u2018P\\u2019 on the carpet upstairs.\\nRight there. See it?\\nAnd it runs all the way, up and out\\u2026 the sides of all the runners going up and down the hallways\\nYou can see him point to it. Oh, yeah, there he is pointing to it.\\nHe thought that was very cool.\\nNo. He didn\\u2019t think it was cool. He thought it was hilarious because if you back up a little to the next photo, it spells \\u201cpoop.\\u201d\\n[audience laughing]\\nSo, why a Christmas special?\\nWell, I\\u2019m sharing with you what I know and what I grew up with.\\nI was raised in a home that celebrated Christmas, so this is a Christmas special.\\nIf I was Jewish, this would be a Hanukkah special.\\nIf I was black, this might be a Kwanzaa special.\\nIf I was an atheist, this would be a special.\\n[audience laughing]\\nBut Christmas is extra special for me, because when I was eight years-old, that year under the Christmas tree, Santa left me my very first ventriloquist dummy.\\nAnd I\\u2019ve shown this photograph before, but I have to show it again because it\\u2019s one of my favorite ones.\\nSo, under the tree is Mom and me and my first dummy and Dad, and there we are right there.\\n[audience applauding]\\n[Jeff] Thank you.\\nI think I love that picture also because you can tell how proud my father is.\\n[audience laughing]\\nBut that moment right there began a lifelong career leading to this very moment here tonight.\\nBut this special is different from any one I\\u2019ve ever done.\\nMy wife Audrey came up with the idea of me and my guys doing our own film version of the Dickens classic, A Christmas Carol.\\nI thought that would be a great movie.\\nWhy not? Let\\u2019s see if we can get it made.\\nBut then in the meantime, I thought, how about for my next stand-up special, what if it\\u2019s me talking to the guys about their possible roles in the film and what characters I think they should play.\\nSo, tonight I\\u2019m casting.\\n[audience laughing, cheering]\\nSo, if you know the Christmas Carol story, see if you can guess who of my guys should play whom in the movie.\\n[laughing]\\nYou guys ready for the little people in the boxes?\\n[audience cheering]\\n\\n\\n\\nThe first guy I\\u2019d like to introduce has been in my act a long time, and I\\u2019m fairly certain you can guess who he\\u2019d play in A Christmas Carol.\\nPlease help me welcome my old friend, Walter.\\n[audience cheering]\\nShut the hell up!\\nGood evening, Walter.\\nAnd why am I dressed like this?\\nI am hot as hell!\\nI know.\\nI think I\\u2019m having a stroke.\\nCome on.\\n[gargling sound]\\nI bet you love the holidays.\\nI bet you\\u2019re an idiot.\\nCome on.

You look great for the occasion.\\nWhat occasion?\\nThis is our Christmas special, and this special is gonna be on Amazon Prime.\\nAmazon?\\nYeah.\\nOh, so they\\u2019re gonna deliver this special and leave it on everyone\\u2019s front porch?\\n[audience laughing]\\nInside another box that\\u2019s ten times the size it needs to be?\\n[audience laughing]\\nThen some jerk comes along and steals it off the porch, and I have to order it all over again?\\nYou know, Amazon makes things very convenient.\\nYeah, and how lazy have we gotten? I mean seriously.\\n\\u201cI need a, uh, a toothpick. I think they\\u2019re upstairs.

The material lacks the sharpness and rhythm that usually define her performances, leaving many of the jokes feeling more like filler than punchlines. Her critique of Dave Chappelle, while likely well-intentioned, detracts from the overall experience, coming off as more self-serving than impactful. The show struggles to find its footing, and what could have been a milestone performance instead leaves an impression of missed potential and underwhelming delivery.\\nMichelle Buteau\\u2019s comedy special, A Buteau-ful Mind at Radio City Music Hall, premiered on December 31, 2024, and is available for streaming on Netflix.\\n* * *\\n[woman] Don\\u2019t forget, brush your teeth.\\n[boy] Why do I have to brush my teeth?\\n[woman] Want your teeth to fall out?\\n[boy] Only one of them.

If you haven\\u2019t done that yet, I really wish that for you. [audience cheers] \\u2018Cause it\\u2019s good. It\\u2019s good. [audience laughs] This guy hit me up one time. He said, \\u201cI\\u2019m a food cooking producer.\\u201d I said, \\u201cGo off, is that a real job?\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cGood for you. Make your space.\\u201d [chuckles] He said, \\u201cI\\u2019d love to do a cooking video with you because you like cooking.\\u201d I said, \\u201cI never said that. That\\u2019s just my look.\\u201d [snickers] [audience laughs] \\u201cOkay.\\u201d He\\u2019s like, \\u201cI have the perfect recipe. Sweet potato casserole.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cOkay.\\u201d \\u201cHow much does it pay?\\u201d And what he told me, I was surprised, because that comma was thick. [audience laughing] I said, \\u201cThis is a nice check.\\u201d \\u201cDo I have to show my feet or some shit?\\u201d [crowd laughs] I\\u2019ve seen Euphoria, I know what the kids are doing for money.\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd he said, \\u201cNo, the company I work for loves you.\\u201d I can\\u2019t legally tell you the name of the company, but I can tell you that it rhymes with \\u201cTampbell\\u2019s Loop.\\u201d [audience laughs] [scattered applause] We all got it? There\\u2019s always one. [crowd laughs] [Michelle chuckles] I didn\\u2019t read the recipe. I showed up on time with a V-neck and some lip gloss. I was like, \\u201cLet\\u2019s make some casserole, honey.\\u201d [audience laughs] They handed me sweet potatoes. I was like, \\u201cSweet potatoes,\\u201d to the camera, \\u201cThat\\u2019s my nickname.\\u201d [vocalizes] [crowd laughs] [Michelle chuckles] The director\\u2019s like, \\u201cThis is a family recipe.\\u201d I said, \\u201cI know.\\u201d [audience laughs] [Michelle chuckles] Hamming it up. Then they handed me salt and pepper. I was like, \\u201cSalt-N-Pepa\\u2019s here. Salt, salt, salt.\\u201d [audience laughs] [Michelle chuckles] Then these people, and I\\u2019m going to call them people, because I know that they\\u2019re someone\\u2019s child, um\\u2026 [smacks lips] They handed me two full cups of shredded cheddar cheese. And I had the same look on my face. I was like, \\u201cAre we making the same recipe?\\u201d [audience laughing] They said, \\u201cYeah, it ties it together.\\u201d I said, \\u201cWho told you that?\\u201d [audience laughing] They said, \\u201cGotta put it in.\\u201d I said, \\u201cListen, now, once I put it in, I can\\u2019t take it out.\\u201d [crowd laughs] \\u201cIt\\u2019s like pee in the pool, okay?\\u201d [audience laughing] Then these people\\u2026 [chuckling]\\n[audience laughing]\\n\\u2026handed me a can of Tampbell\\u2019s Loop\\u2026 [audience cheers and applauds] \\u2026Cream of Mushroom Soup. [audience laughs] [Michelle sighs] [audience laughing] Now, I don\\u2019t know if y\\u2019all have ever seen a fresh can\\u2026 of Tampbell\\u2019s Loop\\u2026 [audience laughing] \\u2026Cream of Mushroom Soup, but\\u2026 she\\u2019s dense, okay? I was like, \\u201cOw, we gotta put our back into it.\\u201d \\u201cYou gotta\\u2026 get a little room temperature.\\u201d [crowd laughs] I mean, I\\u2019m mixing it up, and it\\u2019s a mess. It looks like a dog just had a miscarriage. [audience groaning and laughing] Oh, that dog got more rights for its body than I do, what you talking about? [audience cheering] That bitch will be okay. [audience laughs] So, I\\u2019m trying to mix it up, and the director\\u2019s like, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s wrong, Michelle?\\u201d [chuckles] \\u201cSmile.\\u201d [snickers] [audience laughs] [Michelle hums] [humming continues]\\n[hums, quavers]\\n[audience laughs] [humming fades] So, I put this thing\\u2026 in the oven, and I tell everybody, \\u201cOkay. Get home safe.\\u201d [audience laughing] [chuckles] The director goes, \\u201cWe gotta take it out and eat it and talk about it.\\u201d I said\\u2026 \\u201cWho told you that?\\u201d [audience laughs] He said, \\u201cAll the videos, everyone\\u2019s eating it and talking about it.\\u201d I said, \\u201cWe don\\u2019t have to be them. We could be heroes.\\u201d [audience laughs] [chuckling] He\\u2026 He said, \\u201cI\\u2019m so sorry, Michelle.\\u201d \\u201cBut unless you eat it and talk about it, we can\\u2019t pay you. It\\u2019s in your contract.\\u201d So I pulled it out the oven, I was like\\u2026\\n[hums]\\n[audience laughs] When I took it out of the oven, y\\u2019all, it was bubbling. It looked so personal. [audience laughing] I put it on the countertop, it was just giving the \\u201cCaucacity of Nope.\\u201d [audience laughing] [sighing] So I put this thing\\u2026 in my mouth. And I\\u2019m really trying to think about what I can spend the money on. [audience laughing] Like a good ho. [audience laughing] [scattered applause] Thank you. Hear those people clapping? Them the hoes. [audience laughs and applauds] With the bills. [chuckling] And he was like, you know, \\u201cHow do you feel?\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cLike I\\u2019m in an episode of Fear Factor.\\u201d [crowd laughs] And he\\u2019s like, \\u201cOkay, how does it taste?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cExpensive.\\u201d [audience laughing] And then I wasn\\u2019t crying, but it was a gentle tear, and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cYou can go home now.\\u201d [chuckles] [audience laughs] [Michelle chuckles] So he posts the video, and I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWho gonna see it?\\u201d Who gonna see this 40-second video of me making sweet potato casserole, right? Well\\u2026 [audience laughs] I forgot there\\u2019s this thing called Black Twitter. [audience laughing] And you know? That\\u2019s my bad. The minute I saw myself trending, I was like, \\u201cMy bad.\\u201d I forgot sweet potatoes are the Juneteenth of root vegetables. That\\u2026 is my bad. I need a publicist, an apology tour, I tried to get on Club Shay Shay. He was booked up. [audience laughing] Amanda Seales was about to do a three-part video on my ass. I had to watch High on the Hog seven more times. Ooh, baby! Can\\u2019t be light-skinned, fucking up Black culture. I won\\u2019t be invited to any of the fests. [scattered applause] But I\\u2019ve never seen over 10,000 tweets with my name, so I was like, \\u201cHow bad could it be?\\u201d [audience laughs] Well, there was an auntie who posted every hour on the hour, all in caps. I said, \\u201cOkay, consistency.\\u201d [chuckling] All in caps, she kept writing, \\u201cCALL THE COPS!\\u201d\\nWhat?\\n[crowd laughs] What? [scoffs] [chuckles] We ain\\u2019t gotta involve the police. [crowd laughs] Then a lot of people were like, \\u201cIs Michelle okay?\\u201d I said, \\u201cThank you so much.\\u201d [audience laughing] I don\\u2019t know, I really got to look in, you know? Check in on your strong friends. [chuckling] But the most, like, hilarious, yet hurtful comment that I do remember, somebody was just like, \\u201cDamn\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cSis looks like the housekeeper from Get Out.\\u201d [audience laughing] [imitating the housekeeper] No! No! [wailing] No! [wailing louder] No!\\n[screaming] No!\\n[audience laughing] No! [audience laughing] [Michelle sighs] I just realized how crazy that shit is for you if you\\u2019ve never seen Get Out. [audience laughs] Like, are you okay? [audience laughs] I\\u2019m just bad at internet. I don\\u2019t know how to not care. I either shut off or I just care too much. I thought the hardest conversations I would have with my children would be around racism, being bullied, sexism, but I\\u2019m realizing, I have to figure out how to have a proper conversation with my kids, to have them define their worth without likes and followers. [audience applauds] Yes, welcome to my big-titty TED Talk, bitches. [audience laughs] With dreams as big as her shoulder pads. [crowd laughing] And, you know, my kids are so smart. I\\u2019m hoping it won\\u2019t be hard. I have five-year-old twins.\\n[crowd cheers]\\nThank you. I have boy-girl twins until they tell me otherwise, \\u2019cause Mama is inclusive. [crowd cheers] Let\\u2019s love and evolve, mother\\u2026 They have the cutest names, I think. They have family names, Hazel and Otis. So cute. I got earrings with their initials. [audience laughs] [audience cheering] That\\u2019s right. She\\u2019s a ho for life. [audience laughs] [audience applauds] Oh my goodness. Ros\\u00e9, it\\u2019s so wet. [audience laughs] I didn\\u2019t realize, with twins, everybody wants to talk to you. I didn\\u2019t know that. People, like, walk up to me with agency and purpose. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cAre they twins?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cAre you a pediatrician?\\u201d [audience laughs] But usually it\\u2019s someone that\\u2019s always a twin, and wanna tell me they\\u2019re a twin. Like, \\u201cAre they twins? I\\u2019m a twin.\\u201d \\u201cI don\\u2019t like my twin. We share a birthday cake.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThere\\u2019s a war going on.\\u201d [audience laughing] \\u201cWhat?\\u201d \\u201cWhat?\\u201d And they just stay. \\u201cYeah, my mom likes my twin better.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI see why.\\u201d [audience laughing] They keep talking. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI gotta stop you there.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m not friendly. I just have a double chin.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\n\\n\\n[Michelle chuckling] \\u201cI\\u2019m an asshole, it\\u2019s just ros\\u00e9 and butter. That\\u2019s all it is.\\u201d [crowd howling] Makes you very approachable. Gout is very approachable. [crowd titters] And I didn\\u2019t realize how different kids could be when they\\u2019re the same ingredient. They are so different. Like Hazel? Wow. Hazel has the energy of a 53-year-old Black woman that works at the DMV. [audience laughing] She is wild, she walks up in the playground, she\\u2019s like, \\u201cIs this what y\\u2019all meant to do?\\u201d [audience laughing] Hazelnut. The kids come up to me like, \\u201cMrs. Buteau, Hazel\\u2019s looking through my soul again.\\u201d [audience laughing] We got to do better. Oh my God. She\\u2019s sassy. I don\\u2019t know where she gets it from. [crowd laughs] Okay, you know what? I understand what you\\u2019re talkin\\u2019 about. However, I didn\\u2019t find my voice till I was in my 30s. She\\u2019s five. [crowd laughing] I was leaving the house one time in short sleeves to go food shopping, \\u2019cause that\\u2019s all I motherfucking do. [crowd laughing] And she said, \\u201cMama, you should put on long sleeves \\u2019cause your elbows look old.\\u201d [audience laughing] But here\\u2019s the thing, she ain\\u2019t wrong. My elbows look haunted as fuck. How? When? No one tells you about that in your 40s. It looks like I\\u2019ve been doing a plank for 22 years. [audience howling] How would I know my elbows look like the top of a pigeon\\u2019s head? When? Ladies, what all I need? Ashwagandha? What do I need? Magnesium? These elbows look crazy. My elbows look like the guy in the Indiana Jones movie, that chose the wrong cup. [audience laughing] Thank you, everybody over 38. Thank you. Thank you.\\nI see you.\\n[crowd applauds] [Michelle laughs] Oh my God, sassy children. And they don\\u2019t go to bed. They just are up all the time. She comes downstairs, 10:00 p.m. \\u201cMama, what you doing?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHiding my vape pen now. What\\u2019s good?\\u201d [audience laughing] \\u201cWhat\\u2019s up?\\u201d \\u201cYou already had two bananas. What all you need now?\\u201d [chuckles] [scoffing] My God. And sassy children, they go to bed late, they wake up early. She\\u2019s up 5:30 a.m. every day. I said, \\u201cGo back to bed, girl.\\u201d \\u201cYou ain\\u2019t missing anything.\\u201d [crowd chuckles] \\u201cThere is nothing going on right now.\\u201d \\u201cWe don\\u2019t live on a farm.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cThis is not the military.\\u201d \\u201cYou can go back to bed.\\u201d Oh my God. Hazel has so much energy. She is like\\u2026 Picture DJ Khaled as a five-year-old girl. [audience laughs] She wakes up in the morning, she\\u2019s like,\\n\\u201cGood morning, everybody!\\u201d\\n[air horn plays] [audience applauding] [audience continues applauding] [Michelle chuckles]\\n\\u266a All I do is twin, twin, twin! \\u266a\\n[air horn playing] She the best! Yeah! DJ Donwill, everybody. [audience cheers and applauds] [Michelle laughs] Oh my God. I can\\u2019t talk to Otis the way I talk to Hazel, \\u2019cause he\\u2019s so sweet and, like, quiet. Like, Hazel brings the Black mom out of me, but like a Black mom on Maury Povich. [audience laughing] Oh, baby. We be at Target, I\\u2019m like, [seething] \\u201cGet over here, girl.\\u201d \\u201cWe ain\\u2019t buying no more stuff. We ain\\u2019t buy\\u2026 Put it down!\\u201d [crowd laughs] She makes me feel like an angry ventriloquist. \\u201cGet over here!\\u201d \\u201cPut it down. I said no more stuff, we ain\\u2019t buying no more stuff.\\u201d [audience laughing] [Michelle chuckling] I can\\u2019t talk to Otis like that. Otis has the energy of a tired husband holding his wife\\u2019s purse at Macy\\u2019s. [crowd laughing] I see some of y\\u2019all in here tonight. Thank you so much. [audience chuckling] Otis is so sweet. He even blinks slow when he talks. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cMama\\u2026\\u201d [audience laughing] [audience continues laughing] [Michelle chuckles] I feel bad sometimes, because he\\u2019s growing up in a house with so much, like, strong female energy, but I\\u2019m also just like, \\u201cYou\\u2019re welcome.\\u201d [audience cheers] You know? \\u201cThat\\u2019s the best kind of education you won\\u2019t get in school.\\u201d [chuckling] I feel bad for him sometimes, his first complete sentence when he was three years old was, \\u201cOkay, everybody. Calm down.\\u201d [audience laughs] Otis! I\\u2019m trying to teach him how to be a big boy around the city, you know? Walking a New York City sidewalk, ride the subway, the train. Hold the door open for old people, all that shit. It\\u2019s important. And we were on a very crowded corner one time in New York City, and he yells in front of everybody, \\u201cMama, the blinking hand said we can\\u2019t go now!\\u201d I said, \\u201cThat\\u2019s right, baby.\\u201d And then strangers were just like, \\u201cGood job, Mama.\\u201d \\u201cGood job\\u2026\\u201d And parents know when your kid does something right in public, you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI am a fucking angel.\\u201d [audience laughing] \\u201cI am a walking angel. What are you childless fucks doing? Recycling? Okay.\\u201d \\u201cOkay.\\u201d \\u201cComposting? Okay.\\u201d We are leaving it better than how we found it.

So I call this story \\u201cBirth Control.\\u201d \\u2018Cause if you were thinking about having a kid, listen to this and decide. [crowd laughs] Otis had a big booger in his nose. A big booger and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cMama, how do I get this out?\\u201d Like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s a real question?\\u201d Know when your kid says something you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI\\u2019m worried for the rest of your life\\u201d?

Chasing himself like a dog chasing his tail. I was like, \\u201cThis is not how I want to remember you, you know?\\u201d [crowd laughs] He\\u2019s like, \\u201cMama, I can\\u2019t get it.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI see that.\\u201d I should also mention we were boarding a flight. [audience laughs] [Michelle chuckles] And he said, \\u201cMama, I can\\u2019t get it.\\u201d And so, I made a decision. I went in there and I got it. [crowd laughs] And then he did a move I\\u2019ve never seen a human body do. He folded like a beach chair. [crowd laughs] Laid out on the floor. He was like\\u2026 [squeaking sounds] And then laid. What? And lay down. And then he yelled\\u2026 [chuckling] \\u201cMama, I want to get my booger!\\u201d And then he says, \\u201cPut it back.\\u201d [audience laughs] And there were people behind me. And I had a decision to make. So I put it back. [audience laughing and groaning] [scattered applause] See, half y\\u2019all clap and half y\\u2019all judge, and I see that shit. Okay? That\\u2019s how people looked at me. I wanted to yell at them, like, \\u201cI used to be cool, okay?\\u201d \\u201cI was cool. I\\u2019ve done cocaine off of a dick, I know how complicated noses can be, bitch.\\u201d \\u201cEnjoy your overhead space.\\u201d\\n[scattered cheering and clapping]\\n[Michelle chuckling] It\\u2019s a good time to give my mom a shout-out in the audience.\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\nHi, Mom. Hi, Marie. [chuckles] Oh man, I must have been a sassy kid, \\u2019cause I feel her bone density be different. [crowd laughs] Like, I get it now, you know? I don\\u2019t like to complain, but I feel run-down, y\\u2019all. You know, like, don\\u2019t let the sequence and tulle fool you. [crowd laughs] I am run-down, like, if you come to my house, 5:30 every night, you can catch me on the couch, and I am serving Viola Davis tired. [audience laughs] [puffing and panting] [labored breathing] [imitating Viola Davis] \\u201cI\\u2019m so tired.\\u201d [fake crying] [gasps] [normal voice] So tired. Now I know why my mom looks like that. [audience chuckling] My mom looks like a husky dog in Miami, like\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know if she\\u2019s thirsty or smiling, it\\u2019s just\\u2026 [audience laughing] [panting heavily] [huffs] She always looks like she\\u2019s asking the question and answering it, like\\u2026 [audience laughing] [Michelle panting heavily] Now I get it.

I was like, \\u201cOkay, massage gun helping me out through the day.\\u201d \\u201cCome on.\\u201d And I couldn\\u2019t go nowhere, so I had a friend over and she happens to be a beautiful Black lesbian. I call her \\u201cThe Oracle.\\u201d [crowd laughing] She ever-knowing and glowing. And she saw my Theragun on my table and she goes, \\u201cOkay.\\u201d [audience laughs] I said, \\u201cGirl, that\\u2019s for my sciatica.\\u201d And she\\u2019s like, \\u201cWhatever.\\u201d [crowd howling] I said, \\u201cGirl, it\\u2019s my Theragun.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s got the word \\u2018gun\\u2019 in it.\\u201d And she said, \\u201cDepends where you point it.\\u201d [audience laughs] [Michelle chuckles] I said, \\u201cGirl.\\u201d She said, \\u201cGirl, what?\\u201d I said, \\u201cGirl, you stop.\\u201d She said, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I looked at her, I said, \\u201cGirl.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\u201cYou like to get your pussy beat up like that?\\u201d [audience laughing] [woman] Woo!

Nothing crazy, a dollop will do you. [crowd laughs] And for the most part, we laughed. Some of y\\u2019all were judging. Some of y\\u2019all were curious. [audience laughs] You don\\u2019t see what I see. [audience laughing] [Michelle chuckles] But all I\\u2019m saying is it can be done. It can be done, we can tell jokes and stories and not disparage a whole community. We can do that. We can make it funny.\\nWe just have to work at it, right?\\n[applause]\\nSo if you ever run into Dave Chappelle, can you let him know that shit?\\n[audience cheers loudly]\\nI don\\u2019t think he know that shit. I don\\u2019t think we\\u2019ll run into Dave, \\u2019cause he\\u2019s the GOAT. And he is the GOAT, if that means going off about trans people. Dave. It\\u2019s not funny. It\\u2019s dangerous. Make it funny.\\n[audience cheering and applauding]\\n[Michelle] That\\u2019s all.

[crowd laughs] Girl, set yourself up for success. [audience laughs] Just have some goals. I just don\\u2019t know why people aren\\u2019t doing it anymore. You know? Say you do the thing, and then do the thing.\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\nThat\\u2019s all. Like my friends that are, like, stuck. Right? Always dating the wrong person. The way you do one thing is the way you do everything. Right? If you were in the theater tonight, dating somebody that\\u2019s not good for you, especially the ladies, don\\u2019t do it no more. Leave here tonight and unfollow that motherfucker.\\nThat\\u2019s energy you don\\u2019t have.\\n[audience applauds]\\nOkay?

That is what your family is for.\\n[audience laughing]\\n[Michelle chuckles] Hello? But I also think it\\u2019s important to, like, name the good time and name the bad times, that\\u2019s okay. The hardest time my husband and I had definitely was the pandemic. I didn\\u2019t get how social we were until we were together all\\u2026 the fucking time. [crowd laughs] I would move to another room, he\\u2019d follow me. I\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s up?\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cWhat\\u2019s up?\\u201d His stories were terrible.

I started using this tone with him that I\\u2019d never used with anybody before. It\\u2019s like the tone you use when Alexa ain\\u2019t playing your song. [audience laughs] You know that tone? I was like, [yelling] \\u201cNo. I. Said\\u2026\\u201d [normal voice] What? Why am I talking to him like that? I love him. [woman howling] Name the good, name the bad. That\\u2019s how you get over it, celebrate it. Honestly, like, what I love about me and my husband is that we\\u2019re real partners, right? Like, we celebrate each other\\u2019s wins. And if you\\u2019re with someone who\\u2019s jealous of you, they don\\u2019t understand your power because they\\u2019re not in their power.\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\nOh my goodness. Look at me, shoulder pads. Dropping some wisdom. Where\\u2019s the donation basket? Come on, now. [audience laughs] [Michelle chuckles] Truly, we celebrate shit. I celebrate the small things.

That\\u2019s what I\\u2019m doing. Oh my God. And my husband threw me a party during the pandemic just for me.

Like, I\\u2019m just tired, like\\u2026 You know, once I start hitting that Viola Davis like\\u2026 [panting and coughing] [crowd laughing] Give me the ros\\u00e9, put me to bed. So my husband and I have actually graduated to day dates. Is anybody that old? [crowd applauds] Responsible adult. Ooh, baby. Day dates are amazing. It\\u2019s exactly what it sounds like, a date during the day. Go to a restaurant you can\\u2019t get into Saturday night on Monday afternoon. [audience laughing] You got a prix fixe menu, you taste everything for $45. [audience laughs] [Michelle laughs] Have some wine. Go home in the afternoon, sit and spin on that dick. [audience laughing] Take a shower, get the hot spots, pick the kids up from school in a good-ass mood! [crowd laughing] Oh, I\\u2019m sorry, half of y\\u2019all picking your kids up smelling like badussy? [audience laughing] [audience chuckling] Okay. [Michelle laughs] My husband surprised me with this day date and\\u2026 [sighs] Yes, he is white, but this\\u2026 I don\\u2019t want to say this is about race, but this is the whitest shit I\\u2019ve ever heard. Who is white here, in the front? Thank you so much. What\\u2019s your name?\\nPearl.\\nPearl?\\nCome on.\\n[audience laughs] Pearl? Didn\\u2019t expect you\\u2019d have the whitest, oldest name. [audience laughs] I love your grandma. Okay, Pearl. You tell me if this is white as fuck. And you got be like, \\u201cThat is white as fuck.\\u201d Okay? My husband came home, and he said, \\u201cBaby, I got us two tickets to a reptile sanctuary.\\u201d [crowd laughs] Pearl.\\nThat\\u2019s white as fuck.\\nWhite as fuck. Thank you. [audience laughing and applauding] So I told him, I was like, \\u201cBaby, I can\\u2019t go to a reptile sanctuary.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s\\u2013 that\\u2019s crazy.\\u201d He\\u2019s like, \\u201cWe gotta go, the tickets were cheap.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYou pay?\\u201d [audience laughing] \\u201cThey should be paying us.\\u201d [crowd chuckling] I looked at him, I was like, \\u201cAre you the reptile guy?\\u201d \\u201cI married the reptile guy?\\u201d He\\u2019s like, \\u201cThe reptile guy?\\u201d I said, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t know the reptile guy?\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s the guy whose, like, best friends are his lizards.\\u201d \\u201cHe lives with his mom for too long.\\u201d \\u201cDoesn\\u2019t have a comforter. Just got a dusty sheet, fucking monster.\\u201d [audience chucking] \\u201cHis favorite movie is Scarface. He\\u2019s got the poster.\\u201d \\u201cNo frame, just tacks? Yuck.\\u201d [audience laughing] \\u201cHe just got fired from Jiffy Lube, he\\u2019s got a pull-up bar so his door never closes.\\u201d [crowd chuckling] \\u201cAnd he never wears socks \\u2019cause they\\u2019re all crunchy around his fucking floor.\\u201d [audience laughs and groans] Don\\u2019t ask me how I know the reptile guy. This is what I\\u2019ve heard. My husband is just like, \\u201cI am not the reptile guy, but I really want to go.\\u201d And then he hit me with this European shit when he knows how to get me to do something. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cYou know, it just feels like Americans stop learning in school and then never want to learn.\\u201d [audience groaning] I was like, \\u201cHow dare you be so accurate?\\u201d [audience laughing] I was like, \\u201cFine. I will go look at lizards with you.\\u201d \\u201cBecause I love you.\\u201d And he goes, \\u201cYou know, it might be fun if we got a little high.\\u201d\\n[audience laughing]\\nSo I took an edible. But this time, I only took one. And it was wonderful. All you have to do is just wait two hours and 17 minutes. [crowd roaring] And it was great. I was in a good mood. Nothing was fazing me. I felt joyful. You know, I was, like, driving us to the reptile sanctuary in the Bronx in my minivan. I\\u2019m not proud of that sentence. [audience chuckling] In the Bronx, everyone\\u2019s got road rage. They\\u2019re, like, \\u201cMove over, bitch.\\u201d \\u201cLearn how to park.\\u201d Whatever, and I\\u2026 couldn\\u2019t even care\\u2026 Usually I would yell back, but I was just, like, \\u201cI hope you heal.\\u201d [audience laughing] I was like, \\u201cBeing high is wonderful.\\u201d I was in the pocket. I found parking. Or did it find us?\\n[audience laughing]\\n[Michelle] Woo! What I didn\\u2019t expect was this to be a tour. We were with other people. They were giving, \\u201cShoes optional at Walmart.\\u201d [audience laughing and groaning] You know? They were giving, like, third-generation January 6. [crowd chuckling and groaning] Yeah. You get it. You know, it was a lot of camouflage, but I see you. [audience laughing] [scattered applause] But I didn\\u2019t care. It was like Cowboy Carter. I was like, \\u201cThis is everyone\\u2019s America.\\u201d [crowd laughing] \\u201cThis ain\\u2019t Texas.\\u201d [Michelle chuckling] And it was pretty interesting. The most fascinating thing I learned about was a lizard called \\u201cthe bearded dragon.\\u201d [audience laughs] It wasn\\u2019t a dragon, it was more like a plus-size lizard, I called it Lizzo. [crowd laughing] I thought it was funny, people had mixed reactions. Just trying to be body-positive. Fascinating thing about the bearded dragon is that it can change its gender. And I was like, \\u201cOkay. We\\u2019ve all had a night like that or two.\\u201d\\n[Michelle chuckles]\\n[crowd laughs] Oh, well, at least I have. [audience laughing and whistling] Thank you. And when we walked into the bearded dragon sanctuary, which is again, a sentence I never thought I\\u2019d say, it came right up to me, and I was like, \\u201cOkay.\\u201d And put it\\u2019s, like, little paw on the window. I said, \\u201cOh, here we go.\\u201d Everyone\\u2019s like, \\u201cIt likes you.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI\\u2019m a Leo. I have good energy.\\u201d [audience laughing] We\\u2019re just taking our moment, and we\\u2019re sort of mimicking each other, becoming best friends. I was there so long, I felt like that white girl in that John Travolta movie, Boy in the Plastic Bubble. Do you remember that movie? No one remembers it. Please go home and check it out. John Travolta, in the \\u201970s, made a movie, Boy in the Plastic Bubble, where he has an autoimmune disease. So he has to live in a plastic bubble in his house. But he has shoes on. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhere you going, John?\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cWhere?\\u201d A lot of holes in that story, not in the plastic bubble, anyways\\u2026 So we\\u2019re just vibing, right? I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my God, this is amazing.\\u201d Then its eyes start to roll back. I was like, \\u201cGo off.\\u201d [crowd laughing] And then the lizard goes, \\u201cCome here.\\u201d\\n[audience laughing]\\n[audience continues laughing]\\n\\u201cYeah?\\u201d And it says, \\u201cKeep my wife\\u2019s name out your motherfucking mouth.\\u201d What? [audience roaring] They\\u2019re not even married! It was wild, and the tour guide was, like, so happy. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cShe never does this. She trusts you, she loves you.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cShe sure do, but honestly, right now, it\\u2019s giving they/them, okay?\\u201d [crowd laughing] Just being on the real, real. And then I heard a voice in the pack of camouflage, say\\u2026 \\u201cAh,\\u201d \\u201cYou one of them woke ones?\\u201d [crowd hooting] And so, you know, I\\u2019m a little high. [audience chuckling] And I go, \\u201cWhat did you say?\\u201d \\u201cI couldn\\u2019t hear through your four good teeth.\\u201d [audience laughing and applauding] \\u201cWhat?\\u201d \\u201cWhat?\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cI asked you if you were a woke bitch.\\u201d [crowd gasping] I look at my husband and I go, \\u201cDid she just call me a bitch?\\u201d And he goes like this\\u2026 [audience laughing] [laughter swells] And I said, \\u201cYeah, I, Tonya.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience laughs and groans]\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m one of them woke ones. What\\u2019s up?\\u201d I didn\\u2019t mean to poke the bear, but bitch, don\\u2019t come for me. Then she just started going off. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cThey/them. They trying to get us to say \\u2018they/them\\u2019 all the time.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cSis, you said it, like, seven times.\\u201d [audience laughing] \\u201cYou could do it. You just did. It\\u2019s fine.\\u201d \\u201cOr don\\u2019t, whatever.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cHonestly, if I can be married to someone named \\u2018Gijs\\u2019\\u2026 [crowd laughs] \\u2026you can say \\u2018they/them.'\\u201d [audience laughing] And then she said, \\u201cI am so tired of this bullshit phase, this non-binary, trans bullshit phase.\\u201d That\\u2019s what she said. I was like, \\u201cLook, I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s a phase.\\u201d \\u201cLike, walking down the street, living your truth as a non-binary or trans person, while you know somebody could want to hurt you or kill you is not a phase, that\\u2019s bravery.\\u201d\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\nI said, \\u201cYo.\\u201d \\u201cThem tattooed eyebrows on your face?\\u201d [crowd laughs] \\u201cThat\\u2019s a phase.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cThat\\u2019s not a good one. You ain\\u2019t got no friends?\\u201d Then she just kept coming for me. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cAm I on Fox News?\\u201d \\u201cIs this a low-budget Laura Ingraham? What\\u2026\\u201d See why I don\\u2019t want to see lizards? See what I mean? She just kept going on and on. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cBut biology.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cSpell it.\\u201d [audience laughing] She\\u2019s like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t trust what\\u2019s between their legs.\\u201d \\u201cWhat\\u2019s between their legs? I don\\u2019t trust what\\u2019s between their legs.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhy do you give a shit what\\u2019s between someone\\u2019s legs?\\u201d \\u201cYou sound crazy. If you ain\\u2019t feeding, fucking, or financing, fuck off.\\u201d [audience cheers and applauds] [Michelle] \\u201cMa\\u2019am.\\u201d She just kept going in, and I just kept trying to answer her. I blacked out. I felt like a big-titty George Jefferson. [imitating George Jefferson] \\u201cAnother thing, motherfucker!\\u201d [normal voice] What am I\\u2026 What am I doing? [Michelle snickering] I\\u2019m in comfy shoes to see a lizard. [crowd chuckles] There was so much hate, and I was like, \\u201cYou\\u2019re very black-and-white with shit.\\u201d \\u201cI need you to live in the shades of gray where the love and humanity exists.\\u201d\\n[audience cheering and applauding]\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s what I need from you.\\u201d \\u201cI mean, a trans woman is no less of a woman, even if you don\\u2019t understand, okay?\\u201d \\u201cYou need to love that person. That is someone\\u2019s child.\\u201d [crowd applauds] \\u201cI have children. I have twins. My body couldn\\u2019t carry them.\\u201d \\u201cWe had a surrogate. I\\u2019m no less their mom.\\u201d \\u201cYou understand how love works?\\u201d \\u201cLike, just open your minds.\\u201d But she kept going on, and finally, I was like, \\u201cYou know what?\\u201d \\u201cI am too cute for this conversation.\\u201d I was a little high, now I\\u2019m a little sober, it\\u2019s okay. I said, \\u201cI\\u2019ll wear this outfit tomorrow \\u2019cause people need to see it.\\u201d I walk off. And then she yelled back at me, and she said, \\u201cAnd to think, I was gonna tell you that I loved your sweet potato casserole recipe!\\u201d [air horn plays] [audience cheering] Thank you, guys, so much for supporting me and being a part of history tonight. I might be the first woman to do a special on this stage, but I better not be the fucking last! [audience cheers and applauds] Good night, everybody!

My grandfather comes out,\\ngives her $20 and gave her a kiss.\\n[crowd awws] And then, he gave her another $20, gave her a longer kiss. Then he gave her another $20. Kind of a deeper, mouth-open kind of thing. Went up the back of the thing, snapped the fucking bra. Pulled the bra out, whipped it on the ground, got the hands rolling. The belt line, then got the hand in, went some buns. A little bun-smacking, went down the middle, finger tapping and shit. And then we were all like, \\u201cThis is fucked up,\\u201d uh, because it was my other grandfather.\\n[audience exclaims]\\nYeah. [chuckles] They used to flirt, but we didn\\u2019t know\\u2026 We didn\\u2019t see that coming. Uh\\u2026 [chuckles] Um\\u2026 Yeah, so I, uh\\u2026 my wife is younger than me.\\nAnybody have a younger wife here?\\n[man shouts]\\nYou do, right? You understand what I\\u2019m saying? My wife\\u2019s eight years younger than me. That was fine when we were young, because\\u2026 now that we\\u2019re older, she still looks good, I\\u2019m starting to look a little beaten. Know what I mean? And I don\\u2019t wanna\\u2026 I don\\u2019t want to do plastic surgery. I\\u2019ll never do that. I did try Botox\\u2026 on my dick. I Botoxed my dick. I wanted to make her\\u2026 a freshening-up, give her a better\\u2026 a younger-looking dick to slap around. I felt like\\u2026 I felt bad for her. My dick was starting to get a little\\u2026 a little worn-looking. You know, a little\\u2026 Almost like it needed a cane. It was always kind of leaning. Scoliosis dick. Kind of leaning on the right ball. My left ball was always like, \\u201cHow the fuck do I get left out?\\u201d My right ball was like, \\u201cShh, you\\u2019re gonna wake him.\\u201d \\u201cLet him rest. He\\u2019s tired.\\u201d\\nBut anyways, I Botoxed my dick. Fellas, I know you\\u2019re saying, \\u201cYou can do that?\\u201d Don\\u2019t do it. You\\u2019re better than that. You don\\u2019t need that shit. So I Botoxed mine. The problem is, it takes the wrinkles away. A flaccid penis needs wrinkles to show that it\\u2019s flaccid, you know? That\\u2019s why God gave you wrinkles for a reason. Pull your pants down, a girl sees. You go, \\u201cNo, it gets better than that.\\u201d \\u201cYou just gotta wait.\\u201d Anyways, I took the wrinkles away. I\\u2019m in the fucking, goddamn, uh, YMCA locker room. I\\u2019m naked. A couple of guys walk in. I hear, \\u201cYou got a boner.\\u201d I go, \\u201cNo, no!\\u201d They go, \\u201cThat\\u2019s a boner.\\u201d I go, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not a boner.\\u201d They go, \\u201cNo wrinkles. That\\u2019s a full-on hard-on.\\u201d I go, \\u201cNo, this is Botox. I Botoxed my dick.\\u201d They go, \\u201cThat\\u2019s a full raging hard-on.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s a young-looking dick. Like it belongs on a third-grader.\\u201d I go, \\u201cThat\\u2019s \\u2019cause it\\u2019s not a fucking boner.\\u201d \\u201cThis is a normal fucking flaccid dick.\\u201d I said, \\u201cWould a boner face down?\\u201d They go, \\u201cYours does.\\u201d I said. \\u201cShut the fuck up, man. Don\\u2019t worry about my dick.\\u201d \\u201cJust you get fucking dressed and leave me alone.\\u201d So, anyways, I went home. I was disappointed, reeling from the insults and shit.

It’s been a very interesting past two years. I got divorced in 2022.\\n[audience cheering]\\nOh, my God, thank you so much. It didn’t feel like that at the time.\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd I didn’t expect the news of my divorce to be so widespread and public, and I felt really embarrassed and ashamed. But I didn’t realize that all of these media outlets were acting like a Bat-Signal, letting all potentially interested men know…\\n[audience laughing]\\n…that I was suddenly available. And I’ve never been pursued this much in my life.\\n[audience cheering]\\nOh, my God. It’s very, very exciting and quite shocking, because boys, they never liked me growing up. In the ’90s, in high school, guys, they weren’t into charismatic A cups.\\n[audience laughing]\\nBut things have changed, and now there’s all these men after my divorced-mom energy.\\n[audience cheering]\\nYes. A divorced mom is very special because she doesn’t want commitment.\\n[audience laughing]\\nShe doesn’t wanna have your kids. A divorced mom just wants to get dicked down.\\n[audience laughing, cheering]\\n[men whooping]\\nI don’t care how many brain cells you have. I don’t care if you pronounce hors d’oeuvres “whores devours.”\\nI don’t care.\\n[audience laughing]\\nNo me importa. I don’t care, as long as you have a huge boner for me all the time. I need you to have a huge boner that’s gonna poke my brain. I need you to smash my frontal cortex over and over and just tenderize all of my fear and paranoia about AI technology. Just… Bam-bam-bam-bam-bam-bam-bam!\\n[audience cheering]\\nI’m not trying to trap a man anymore. Mm-mm. I’m trying to catch a concussion.\\n[audience laughing]\\nYes. I’m trying to drink cranberry juice on the regular, okay?\\n[audience laughing]\\nThat’s right. When I introduce myself to new men, I’m trying to say hello like this, “Hey. How you doing? Come here.” “I wanna talk to you. I got a question for you.” “Have you had a vasectomy?”\\n[audience laughing]\\n[chuckles softly] Uh, I really went on a tear when I first got divorced. You missed it. I was on sale.\\n[chuckles]\\n[audience laughing]\\nI’d been married for ten years, so I had that, like, “just got out of prison” energy, you know? And my standards were strategically low. Like the less hair on the head, the more hair on the body, the better.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI was hunting for a dude that was shaped like a straight-up squash.\\n[audience laughing]\\n\\n\\n\\n[man] I’m here!\\n‘Cause you know what kind of energy that dude’s bringing to the bedroom? Gratitude.\\n[audience laughing]\\nHe will eat your pussy long, long time.\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd you will be free of that guilt, that concern that you’re taking too long to finish. Instead, you’re like, “Yeah, you stay down there, you lucky mediocre man, you.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nI do have some standards when it comes to getting dicked down, like you gotta pay for the first date. Yeah, come on, man. You gotta pay for the first date. I know that sounds crazy, because I’m a millionaire.\\n[audience laughing]\\n[audience cheering]\\nOh. [chuckles] I am. Don’t let this Midsummer outfit fool you now, okay? I’m a millionaire, straight up. But you still gotta pay for the first date, because you gotta show me that you understand basic investment strategy.\\n[audience laughing]\\nThe money will come back to you, okay? Trust and believe. If you have faith in your product, and it performs well on the market and stays up… the cost of those tapas and that cacio e pepe will seem like nothing when I get you a two-bedroom condo in Reseda, okay?\\n[audience laughing]\\nYeah, Los Angeles proper, that’s too expensive. But Reseda…\\n[audience laughing]\\nI’ll get you stainless steel appliances, side-by-side two-car parking. I’ll get you a TOTO toilet. Ooh, you know what a TOTO toilet is?\\n[audience cheering]\\nYeah. A TOTO toilet is this magical Japanese toilet. The seat is always warm, and then when you sit on it, Hello Kitty and Godzilla emerge and go like this… [babbling] …to your butthole, okay?\\n[audience laughing]\\nYou know how expensive that is to get Hello Kitty and Godzilla to link arms and double-team your taint after you take a shit?\\n[audience laughing]\\nHello Kitty doesn’t even have a mouth. [audience laughing] But I can make the impossible possible, you know? [audience laughing] Listen, if I get you that two-bedroom condo in Reseda, you better be at that two-bedroom condo in Reseda, available to dick me down when I am finished performing at the Wiltern in my nightgown, okay?\\n[audience cheering]\\nYes. You better be there, because you cannot be both poor and busy.\\n[audience laughing]\\nThat is an unacceptable combination. Why don’t we just add ugly and anger management issues while we’re at it?\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd I better not catch you subletting that second bedroom. [audience laughing] In 2022, I joined a dating app. I really did. And I paid $250 up front for the entire year. Because then you save $5 a month.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI might be rich, but I’m still Chinese.\\n[woman] Yeah!\\nYes.\\n[audience applauding]\\nI still suffer from scarcity mindset. I am still so devastatingly cheap. Like, I will drink soy milk long past its expiration date, when it has transformed into tofu. I will pour that on my Shredded Wheat. I will. I maintain a friendship with a woman that I hate simply because she has a lemon tree. [audience laughing hysterically]\\n[woman] Yes!\\nThe day after I joined that app, I get a phone call from this dude who I had met at, like, two dinner parties in the past. And he got my number from a mutual friend, a mutual colleague, and he was like, “Hey, Ali.” [chuckles softly] “I just happened to hear the news of your divorce today, and I gotta tell you… I’m excited.” [audience laughing] “I am, Ali, because, look, I have had a crush on you forever, and I actually told my best friend years ago that you were my dream girl.” “And I know this sounds crazy, but, uh… I want you to be my girlfriend.” [audience exclaims softly] And I was like… “I just paid $250.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“You seem really nice, but… I gotta get my money’s worth.” [audience laughing] Shortly after that phone call, I take off to Europe. I arrive in London and discovered that this man had sent me a bouquet of flowers that was this big. And then I get to Amsterdam, and he sent me a bouquet of flowers that was this big. And then I get to Cologne. He sent a flower arrangement the size of me. And then in my final destination, Copenhagen, he sent me six giant flower arrangements. [gasps] I told all my girlfriends, and they were like, “Oh, my God, that is so sweet. I am so jealous.” And then I told all my male friends, and they were like, “That dude sounds like a psychopath.” [audience laughing] “Hey, are you okay, Ali? Do you feel safe?” [audience laughing] That’s how cheap and lazy men have become, that now, when a fellow man commits any act of kindness, any romantic gesture, it must be a symptom of an undiagnosed mental illness.\\n[audience laughing]\\nIt is true that boys, they never liked me growing up. I was always too loud. I had a mustache. They called me “booger girl” because I picked my nose all the time. So it was very cruel, but very accurate, you know? [audience laughing] And now I’m 42, I’m a mother, and something has truly shifted in my favor. And I think that what happened was that… Men, you know, when you’re in your twenties, all you wanna date is a ten, right? At that age, you don’t care about the content of a woman’s character. You don’t care about her creative output. Uh… You know, the ultimate status symbol when you’re young is to just date a beautiful, busty ten. And then when men become 40, you’re like, “I don’t wanna date a ten anymore.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“All I want is a kind six… [audience cheering] …that earns at least, like, $15,000 a year, and is generally a peaceful person.” [audience laughing] But you’re too late, ’cause all the kind sixes have been snatched up. And it’s not the status symbol it used to be. It’s not necessarily a good look to date a ten anymore. Nowadays, when we’re 40, you bring some hot unfunny dummy to dinner, all the women of substance at the table are now mad at you because we have to babysit this bitch. [audience laughing] While, you’re here outsourcing for intellectual stimulation and giggles, we’re the ones who have to listen to her boring ass stories about cauliflower rice and the power of crystals. [audience laughing]\\n[audience whooping]\\nUh-uh. You have ruined dinner for us, and now we’ve all lost respect for you because you have revealed that you have bad taste! [audience laughing] The worst part about being a female stand-up comedian is having to socialize with male stand-up comedians’ girlfriends. Oh, my God. It’s so painful. It’s worse than being sexually harassed. So many wasted hours of my life having to sit next to these Instahoes. These Instahoes who prey on my friend because he’s so ugly. He’s been ugly his whole life, and no woman who looks like that has ever looked at him. And these Instahoes, they’re smart. They know that the day is coming when these sunscreen companies stop paying them to pose in a thong on an inflatable doughnut.\\n[audience laughing]\\nSo to look out for their future, they sink their pussy teeth into my friend’s bald ass head until he can’t think for himself anymore, because they know he has a potential to go far with his podcast and not sign a prenup. [audience laughing] And because I’m a kind six, I listen to them. I listen to them! [audience laughing] [exhales] And because I’m a decent actress, they think I’m actually listening, when really, I’m just looking at them in the eye and smiling, but in my head I’m composing my wish list for Amazon Prime Day.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI have to say, it’s very nice to feel so loved and adored after being ignored by men for so long. And I’ve received all sorts of nice gifts from suitors in the past two years. I’ve received flowers, bags, jewelry. My girlfriends were like, “Oh, my God.” [scoffs] “Jewelry?” “But, Ali, how can you accept that?” I’m like, “Oh, it’s easy. I just accept it, you know?” [audience laughing] “It’s the easiest thing I’ve ever done in my life.” “What’s not to accept? It’s beautiful, valuable, and free.” “That’s a Chinese fairy tale. I’mma take it.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience applauding, cheering]\\nI don’t see how refusing 24-karat gold is the more empowering option. It’s not like when these dudes give you a necklace, then make you sign a contract, being like, “Okay, if you accept this necklace, then you agree to suck my dick.” [audience laughing] No! You just say, “Oh, my God, Trevor.” “This is so thoughtful of you. This is beautiful.” “Thank you. Thank you so much.” And then you just take the necklace and then you walk away… [audience laughing] Or you suck their dick. It’s up to you. What do you wanna do? [audience laughing] It’s your choice. But either way, keep the necklace. [audience laughing] I became so addicted to courtship, that I developed this problem where I kept on breaking up with dudes after three weeks. After three weeks, that’s when they start to relax. That’s when the flowers stop coming. That’s when they stop initiating going down on you. [gasps] You’re fired, bro. You’re fired.\\n[audience laughing]\\nMm-mm. I don’t actually say “you’re fired,” okay? What I say is, “Hey.” [chuckles softly] “I can’t tell you what the past three weeks have meant to me.” “You have given me what I didn’t even know I needed.” “And, my God, you are such a beautiful, special human being.” “And I just feel like it’s time for me to really focus on my work and my family.” And blah, blah, blah! Right? [audience whooping] And the last dude I split with was this big, fancy movie director, and he had a very movie director response to my speech. He was like, “That feels false.”\\n[chuckles]\\n[audience laughing] “That feels false, Ali.” “Why don’t you tell me why you’re really breaking up with me.” I was like, “Okay, fine.” “Well, you know it’s because the last two times we hooked up, you didn’t initiate going down on me, and I didn’t really like that.” [audience laughing] And he was like, “Well… [chuckles] …why didn’t you just communicate that to me?” I was like, “Oh.” “Well, because I’m divorced.” “I don’t do that anymore.” [audience laughing] Communicate? That’s married-people shit, okay? I’m retired from that. You think I got divorced from one man to communicate obvious shit to another man?\\n[audience cheering]\\n[cackling] Fuck that lateral step. I’m out here for a lifestyle change, okay? You think I went through the shame and stigma of divorce to be out here in these streets, saying shit to myself like, “Oh!” “Sometimes the right thing to say is the hard thing to say”? [audience laughing] You know, especially when it comes to initiating giving head to a woman. That’s not something that should happen upon request. It’s steps on the initiation. I refuse… I refuse in the middle of kissing a man to say to him… [in deep voice] “Eat my pussy.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nHow humiliating. [in deep voice] “Eat my pussy.” [in normal voice] What am I, a villain in a Disney movie? [in deep voice] “Fee-fi-fo-fum.” “Eat my pussy.” [audience laughing] Do I have to spell out all the basics to you? [in deep voice] “Eat my pussy.” “Compliment my looks.” “Wish me a happy birthday.”\\n[in normal voice] It’s like…\\n[audience laughing] [chuckles] I came up with that joke while breaking up with that director in real time… [audience laughing] [audience cheering] [laughs] …out loud in front of his face. [audience laughs] [chuckles] As soon as he was like, [mimicking] “Why don’t you just communicate that to me?” I was like, “Well, what am I supposed to say?” [in deep voice] “Eat my pussy?” [laughs] [audience laughing] And then I started marching around all the pretentious ass sculptures in his living room. I was like, “Fee-fi-fo-fum.” “Lick my taint, or I’ll blow your house down.” [audience laughing] My God, and I was laughing so hard at how hilarious I was being. And I was so excited that I had just come up with this joke that I could make money off of later. I was like, “Ooh!” We turned that into lemonade real fast, you know? [audience laughing]\\n[laughing]\\n[audience cheering, applauding] Yeah. And I was so busy having fun with myself, I wasn’t paying any attention to him. And then I finally looked up, and he was like, “That’s not funny, Ali.” [audience laughs] “Come on, that’s really rude. You know, that’s not funny at all.” “Uh… All right, I guess you don’t know this, but, Ali, no one has ever broken up with me before.” “And, you know, there’s a reason for that.” “So I hope you know that if you do this, you’re gonna regret it for the rest of your life.” “Because, Ali, you’re never gonna find somebody like me.” I was like, “Yeah, that’s what I’m hoping. That’s the whole point of breaking up.” “I don’t wanna be with you or anybody like you again.” “You don’t initiate giving head, and you didn’t laugh at ‘fee-fi-fo-fum.'” That’s two red flags.\\n[audience laughing]\\n[audience cheering]\\nAnd then he says to me, “All right, you know what, Ali?” “I’m in a really bad place right now, and I swear to God, if you’re serious, like, if you really actually mean this, I might kill myself.” [audience exclaiming softly] I was like, “Go for it.” [audience laughing] “Either way, we’re not gonna be together.” “So same same, but different.” [audience laughing] And then I said to him, “I don’t actually mean that, okay?” “I think you’re a good person. We’re just a bad match.” “And please save your energy and refrain from threatening me.” “You don’t seem to understand.” “I’m a financially independent divorced mom.”\\nYeah.\\n[audience cheering]\\n“So, I’m not looking for someone to build a life with, okay?” “I’m not scared to die alone.” [audience laughing] “And breaking up with you is so easy compared to divorce.” “We don’t have property together, we don’t have kids.” “So breaking up with you is nothing.” “It’s like putting down a burrito when I’m full.” “It’s nada.” [audience laughing] “But thank you so much again for the necklace.” “I love it so much.”\\n“And…\\n[audience cheering]\\nI’m going to cherish it for the rest of my life until I sell it on The RealReal, a’ight?” [chuckles] ‘Cause I’m telling you, after you get divorced, three weeks is perfect. After that, I don’t like it when shit gets too real, when these dudes start to say things to me like, “You know, Ali, I just… I really feel like I can be myself around you.” I’m like, “Please don’t, okay?” “Please just be the best parts of yourself, and then repress all the shitty parts.” “Save that for your friends and family who are gonna be there for you if you get diagnosed with cancer.” “‘Cause I’m not gonna be there, okay?” “I don’t know you, man. It’s been three weeks.” “It’s still unclear to me if you’re Filipino or Cambodian.”\\n“I don’t know you!”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“Know you!” You know, I think, women, when you’re in your twenties… I was like this when I was younger, okay? You tend to get very flattered, you tend to feel very special when a man is vulnerable with you, when he opens up to you about his trauma. [fake crying] “You know, Ali… when I was a little boy… my uncle, he…” I’m gonna stop you right there, okay? “Hey! Snap out of it, man! Snap out of it! Come on!” “Let’s keep it positive, let’s keep it sexy.” I’m here for orgasms and free oysters. That’s it, okay? [audience laughing] But if you’re a kind six like me, these dudes, they don’t wanna just dick you down. In exchange, they want you to be their mommy-therapist. They call me up, and they’re like, “Ali, I am having the worst fucking day.” I’m like, “Well then, hang up the fucking phone.” [audience laughing] “I don’t know why you think it’s acceptable to spread that shit to my day.” “I’m having a great time.” “I’m in my professionally interior decorated home that’s loaded with TOTO toilets.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nI’m with my two daughters right now. Oh, my God, they’re so cute. They’re six and eight years old now. Can you believe that? Six and eight years old? [audience cheering] They were in that striped dress and in that leopard dress, now they’re out and about, six and eight years old. We watch RuPaul’s Drag Race together every Saturday morning. Yeah. And then, they got these real cute Asian Amélie haircuts that I gave to them ever since they were two. I trim their hair every single day. I do. They’re like my little bonsais, you know? [audience laughing] I really do believe that, for a woman, 40 is the golden age… [audience cheering, applauding] …to get divorced.\\nIt is perfect.\\n[audience laughing] I’m so sorry if you bought your wife tickets tonight thinking that it would be a cute anniversary or birthday gift. But I have to spread the good word. Forty is a great time to get divorced. The age range of who I could date is huge. It’ll never be this huge again. I could go as low as 25, and then I could go as high as 55. Uh… If you’re 55, I got questions for you. Like can you go on a brisk walk? [audience laughing] Can you lift heavy things? Can you digest red meat without getting a swollen toe the next day? Can you? Puedes? Es posible? Well, if the answer is yes to all of the above, then I’m open, all right? So I matched with this one 55-year-old on the app. And you could tell that he was 55. He had salt-and-pepper hair, it was a lot of gray and white hair, but it was thick and long and lush, and he had this beautiful beard to match. And he was a former pro surfer that continued to surf every day, so he was tan and ripped. He was old, but he was sexy in this very eye-catching way that reminded me of King Triton from The Little Mermaid.\\n[audience laughing]\\nYou remember watching that movie as a little girl, and King Triton floats onto the screen, and you were like, “Oh”? [chuckles] “Who is this ocean Santa Claus… with a six-pack and a tail? What’s up, King Triton? How you doing?” “Come here, I wanna talk to you. Got a question for you.” “Where’s Ariel’s mom at? Is she dead or…?” “You two get divorced? You stop fucking? You in an open situation?” “Where is she?” “All right, I got another question for you.” [audience laughing] “Where’s your dick at? You got a dick under that tail?”\\n[audience laughing]\\nSo I meet up with the 55-year-old in person. We sit down to dinner. I take a look at him, and I was like… “Huh.” [audience laughs] “Oh, you’re not 55, are you?” He was like, “No, I’m 60.” “Ali, look, I’m really sorry, okay?” “I should’ve come clean to you about this sooner. I was just…” “I was so excited to meet you.” “When I first joined the app, I accidentally, honestly, entered in my birthday in wrong, and the app wouldn’t let me go back and change it.” “And because that app is so exclusive, I didn’t wanna get on the waitlist again.” “And yes, all of those pictures on my profile are admittedly from five years ago when I first joined, because I’ve just simply been too lazy to take and upload new ones.” “Ali, look, I really apologize, okay?” “And I totally get it if you just wanna get up and leave right now.” I was like, “No, it’s fine, you know?” “We’re already here, and gas so expensive.” [audience laughing] And I said to him, “Hey, now that I’m seeing you in person, yes, you do look a little bit older, but I have to say, you have the most beautiful, interesting eyes that I’ve ever seen in my life.” And he was like, “Oh.” [chuckles softly] “Yeah, that’s ’cause I have glaucoma.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nI was like, “You should’ve kept that shit to yourself, man.” Now when I go to the bathroom, I have to Google, “What is glaucoma?” [audience laughing] It’s wild, because, you know, I’m 42. I’ve never fucked a 60-year-old man before. And I have to say that it was awesome.\\n[audience laughing]\\n[audience cheering]\\nYeah. It was, it really was. I would highly recommend fucking a 60-year-old man if you like it when a man cums and he screams violently… [audience laughing] …as if you were pulling his nose right off of his face. Just… [screams] You know, really makes you feel alive because he might be dead. [audience laughing] Oh, fucking a dude that’s 60 is especially great if you’re into it when a man ejaculates and then he physically collapses on top of you. And then you feel like you just pulled the wrong piece out of a Jenga tower, right? Like, you thought you were gonna go down in history as this Asian-American pioneer of motherhood and comedy, but no, your legacy is you’re a murderer now. That’s how you’ll be remembered. Oh, but the best part about fucking a dude that’s 60 is that you get to hear a story…\\n[audience laughing]\\n…that he already told you on Tuesday… [audience laughing] …that he’s gonna repeat to you on Friday, about a half-court shot he once made in 1985. [audience laughing] Listen, I am being sincere when I said that it was awesome, because it was, okay? Let’s not forget that this dude is a former pro surfer. So he’s been fucking women his whole life. Whole life. He’s got all kinds of tricks up his sleeve. All this shit, right? This shit. Spitting on his knee. [mimics spitting] This shit. You know? [chuckles] Then spitting on his toes. [mimics spitting] I’ve never seen that before. Whoo! Like, using his leg like a tentacle. ‘Cause he’s a man of the ocean, you know? He got an octopus teacher. He got seahorse friends advising him and shit. He is one with the mollusks. He’s Aquaman.\\n[audience laughing]\\nUh… And then he was looking at me the entire time with those iridescent Night King eyes.\\n[audience laughing]\\nThose hologram “winter is coming” eyes, you know? Made the whole experience both majestic and terrifying. Had me feeling like if I failed to cum at the same time as him, he was gonna put a curse on me. And then at midnight, I was gonna turn into a little baby Minotaur with psoriasis. [audience laughs] We did climax simultaneously. Very rare for the first time you fuck somebody. And it was amazing, it was very intense. Bing-bing-bing-bing-bing-bing. It was great. Uh… But then he screamed in my ear. [audience laughing] And I swear to God, it was so loud… it made my vision blurry. [audience laughing] And then he just went full boneless and turned into a 200 lb human flesh puppet on top of me. He just wouldn’t move. And my heart sank to my stomach. I was like, “Oh, my God, he’s dead.” [audience laughing] And then when he started breathing again, I’ve never felt relief like that in my life. Spread to my fingertips, my toes, and my nose. It was like I came twice.\\n[audience laughing]\\nThe only sensation better than an orgasm is knowing you’re not actually gonna go to jail. [audience laughing] The first person to contact me after the announcement of my divorce was this 25-year-old half-Vietnamese bro from Texas, living in Chicago. And he was super-duper hot, but I was very reticent to respond to him because he’s 25 years old. That’s young. That means he doesn’t know who Kato Kaelin is, he’s never drunk Crystal Pepsi or watched E.T. Like, what the fuck are we gonna talk about, you know?\\n[audience laughing]\\nSo I was ignoring his DMs, and then he sent me a thirst-trap video. That’s way past my time, okay? I’ve never received one of those before, so I didn’t know what was happening. He sends me this video where he’s in a bathroom and the shower’s running. I was like, “What’s going on? This kid okay?” “Is he depressed or something?” “Is he about to hurt himself? Is this a cry for help?” And then he proceeded to take off his shirt, and he was just jacked, and then he did that shit with his pecs.\\nCh-ch-ch-ch-ch.\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience laughing] [chuckles] Like a Toni Braxton video. I was like, “Oh, my God.” And then he proceeded to adjust his sweatpants. And then he was like… [smacking lips] And then the video ends, and I was like… [gasps] [audience laughing] And then I watched the video ten more times. [audience laughs] Each time, just zeroing in more and more at that part at the end where he’s adjusting his sweatpants. I’m trying to detect from the lighting, from the tug of the fabric, like, how big is this thing, you know? My God, he was so smart to not show me it, but instead show me the silhouette of it. It was very burlesque of him. [audience laughing] [man whooping] So he flew to LA, and I fucked the shit out of him.\\n[audience laughing]\\nOh, my God. Oh! [audience cheering, applauding] It was so good. My toes are curled up in two fists right now just thinking about it again. It was so good that I decided to fly to Chicago two weeks later to fuck him again. [audience cheering] Yes. And I could tell that he was broke, because all of his thirst-trap videos were filmed in a YMCA bathroom.\\n[audience laughing]\\n[Ali clears throat] So I called him up before I left for Chicago, and I said, “Hey, I’m so excited to see you again, and, uh, I wanna stay at a nice hotel.” “I wanna eat at great restaurants, and I wanna do fun things.” “So while I’m there, I’m gonna pay for everything.” He was like, “Sick.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n[sighs in relief] “Cowabunga…” [laughs]\\n[audience laughing]\\nI land there, and we have a great night together. And then in the morning, he was like, “What’d you wanna do today?” I was like, “I wanna go to the museum.” He was like, “I’m down to see dinosaurs.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nI like, “No, man, I wanna go to the Art Institute of Chicago. “It is arguably the best museum in the US.” “It’s where that famous scene from Ferris Bueller’s Day Off was filmed.” “Oh, my God.” “You don’t know what Ferris Bueller’s Day Off is.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nAnd so we go there, and because it’s my favorite museum, we spent three hours there. I didn’t realize that until we were leaving. I was like, “Oh, my God, we’ve been here for three hours.” “Are you okay?” “Was that, like, total utter torture for you?” He was like, “No.” “All this art? Fire!” [audience laughing] “Fire, bro. That dude Monet? Fire.” [audience laughing] I was like, “Did you just say… [mispronouncing] ‘Monet’?” [audience laughing] “Okay, I’m gonna fuck you like six more times.” [audience laughing] Traditionally, I have exclusively dated Asian-American men. I still find them to be the sexiest. I do. Like when I watched Squid Game, I was like, “Oh, my God.” Whoo! “I like that one, I like that one, I like that one, and I like that one.” And then when I watched Avatar: The Last Airbender, the cartoon, I was like, “I like that one, I like that one, I like that one, I like that one.” I like Prince Zuko, I like Uncle Iroh, I like Appa. I like all of them.\\n[audience laughing]\\n[laughs] So, you know, historically, I have exclusively dated Asian-American men, but I have now opened myself up to taste the rainbow. [audience laughing] Yes. And for the first time in my life, I have dated quite a few white men. That’s not really part of the rainbow… [audience laughing] …but it’s like the cloud at the end of the rainbow. And I do believe that the precipitation from clouds is crucial to the forma… You know what? I’m not a climatologist. You get it, okay? In the past two years, I’ve fucked a lot of dudes named Blake. [audience laughing] And for whatever reason, it has specifically been a lot of white dudes from the Midwest. And while all of them have been oh so very kind, I don’t know that me and any of those dudes could’ve lasted long-term, because these white dudes from the Midwest, their diet, their palate, is so limited. I’m a very adventurous eater, okay? I eat pigs’ feet, I eat durian, I eat snails, I eat everything. Yeah. But these white dudes from the Midwest, they get diarrhea… [audience laughing] …every time they eat a dish that’s not a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI’m like, “Oh, my God, Blake, you have diarrhea again?” “From soy sauce?” “The Kikkoman soy sauce was too spicy for you, Blake?” “Do you wanna get extra mild soy sauce next time?” “Do you wanna just dip your California roll in mayonnaise water moving forward?”\\n[audience laughing]\\nThen these white dudes from the Midwest, they’re always yucking my yum, acting like the food I eat is gross and crazy. I’m like, “No, Blake. The food you eat is gross and crazy.” One night for dinner, I witness Blake eat a slice of cheese pizza with a glass of cold milk and ice cream for dessert. He had milk three ways. [audience laughing] A straight tres leches meal… [audience laughing] …was the most lactose-tolerant human being I’d ever met in my life. He was like a cat, a mouse, and a toddler wrapped up in one.\\n[audience laughing]\\n[scoffs] Oh, my God, it blew my mind the first night we ate fried chicken together, because you know, I eat my meat to the bone, like a good Vietnamese girl. I eat the cartilage, the marrow, the gristle… [audience cheering] …the skin. I eat everything. Uh, Blake took one bite of his drumstick and then moved right on to the next piece, leaving enough meat on the bone to feed all the Whos in Whoville.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI was like, “Oh, what’s for dessert?” “Dollar bills on fire?” [audience laughing] And then one afternoon, I take him to the San Gabriel Valley, which is like the mecca for Chinese food here in Los Angeles. And I take him to this fantastic, very authentic Chinese restaurant, and we meet up with my college friend Hai. And Hai was trying to be friendly and make small talk with Blake, and he says, “Hey, Blake, does Ali have you eating all sorts of crazy shit?” And Blake was like, “Yeah, it’s a lot of stuff that I’m not used to, but I try to be open. It’s important to me to try new things.” And then Hai says to me, “Ali, look what Blake just did.” And Blake had poured tea for the three of us into our rice bowls.\\n[audience laughing]\\nHe was like, “I don’t understand. Where’s the tea supposed to go?” And then Hai pushed the teacups forward. And Blake was like, “But that’s too small for tea.” And Hai was like, “Well, it’s definitely too small for rice.” Then he says, “You know what? It’s all good, bro.” “‘Cause I was low-carb, but today, I’m no carb.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd then Blake started flipping out about all the tendon and sea cucumber that Hai and I were ordering. And he’s like, “Ali, can you please just order me a pork bun?” So I get him a pork bun, and he ate it with the paper still on. [audience laughing] I think for the longest time I was so focused on getting dicked down because the task of finding a boyfriend, someone who I consider talented, someone who makes me laugh, someone who I have a real connection with, someone who I look up to as an artist, someone that I would feel proud to introduce to my kids, my peers and my friends and my mentors. I mean, that seemed impossible, you know? Like, if you wanna be my boyfriend, too, just to start, you gotta be a divorced dad. Yeah. You gotta be a divorced dad because I want a man that’s been pre-yelled at.\\n[audience laughing]\\nTurnkey ready, know what I’m saying? I want that cast iron skillet seasoned. I want a man whose inner spirit has already been crushed by his ex-wife, my guardian angel, my master, my shifu, who has ordered him around to death and taken half of his money so that I seem like an easygoing cheerleader in comparison. One woman’s trash is another woman’s trained trash. [audience laughing]\\n[chuckles]\\n[man] Yeah! I don’t want a man that’s broke, but I do want a man that’s broken, okay? Yeah, I wanna see some dings on that CARFAX report. I wanna see that in 2020, there was a head-on collision when David put the wet dishes on top of the dry dishes. [audience laughing] I don’t want one of these dudes that’s 40 years old, been single their whole life, no marriage, no kids. Uh-uh. Those men age, but they don’t grow up. [audience laughing] Right? They get very easily overwhelmed.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI want a man that doesn’t take an entire day to put a duvet cover on a duvet. I want a man who knows how to buy other fruit besides bananas. [audience laughing] And look, if you wanna be my boyfriend, I accept occasional erectile dysfunction, okay? Yeah, we’re 40. Erectile dysfunction is like climate change. It’s here. Don’t be in denial.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI accept occasional erectile dysfunction, just as long as you know how to pivot. You have to pivot fast. You gotta eat out my ass right away. Right away. Within milliseconds. Nothing will make me forget and forgive faster than when you place the hole where food goes in right on top of the hole where food goes out. Ooh! You know? It’s a complete reset. It’s like the Men in Black pen. This is the new beginning now. You know?\\n[audience laughing]\\n[chuckles] What I definitely don’t want instead of the pivot is to have to hear the excuse, the explanation, the speech, as to why your boner has gone soft. [in a high-pitched voice] “Oh, I’ve had a very stressful day.” “I had a long Zoom, and then I played pickleball for two hours.” “I’m exhausted. A lot on my mind. My grandma’s sick…” Nobody gives a shit. Put your tongue in the booty hole now.\\n[audience laughing]\\nLengua en el culo ahorita. [audience laughing] [chuckles] All right, I think this next point should be obvious. If you wanna be my boyfriend, you better be nasty. Yeah. A lot of men out there aren’t nasty. A lot of men refuse to kiss after they’ve cum in your mouth. How rude. [audience laughing] I just sucked your dick. My knees have those puffy red circles on them. My topknot has migrated to the side of my head. [audience laughing] And you can’t… [mimicking kiss] “Thank you. Thank you so much.” “Thank you, Emmy, Golden Globe winner Ali Wong… [audience cheering] …for sucking my dick.” That’s your jizz in my mouth. Why are you acting grossed out? That’s like being like, “Ugh! Who farted?” “You farted. You jizzed and you farted.” [audience laughing] “That’s your fart, your cum, your responsibility. Now kiss me.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“You know what? Your jizz isn’t even in my mouth anymore, because I swallowed it since I’m a kind six.” [audience laughing] I should clarify, there are no globs of jizz in my mouth anymore. There is a film, a coating, a whisper, if you will, similar to when you eat a bag of Cheetos. The Cheetos are in your tummy, but the orange dust, the sabor, the essence, the spirit of the Cheeto, still remains and lingers. Yes. [man whoops] [chuckles] Look, I’m not saying you have to give me head day one of my period. That’s disgusting, okay? I know the difference between nasty and disgusting. That’s disgusting. You do not have to give me head day one of my period. But when we have landed at day four… and it has petered out into a watery salsa… [audience laughing hysterically] What are you scared of, you baby? There’s iron in there, okay?\\n[audience laughing hysterically]\\nThere’s nutritional benefit. Tomorrow, you can skip putting spinach in your smoothie because of me.\\n[audience laughing]\\nSo while I was very focused on getting dicked down, at the same time, I was always, deep down, looking forward to falling in love. I mean that. I’m a romantic ho like that, okay? I love falling in love. I believe it’s the best feeling in the world. They call it “falling” for a reason, because it’s momentous, you know? I love that beginning magical period where you only see the positive qualities in somebody else. Right? And then you feel like a better person… because you’re pretending to be a better person. [audience laughing] I like the challenge of having to impress somebody else. I like wondering, “Oh, my God.” “Does this person like me as much as I like them?” And then when you finally have sex after all that anticipation… [inhales sharply] …it’s never that good again, right? Right? When they enter you for the first time, and you give each other that look… You know, that look that’s just like…\\n[breath shaking]\\n[audience laughing] It’s so good. Because they’re not just sticking their dick inside of your pussy… Mm-mm. …they’re filling the hole in your heart… [audience laughing] …that you didn’t know was there in the first place. Now, I have fallen in love once since my divorce, and that hole got filled. It did. But it made me curious about how many other holes are in my heart. [audience laughing] And if my heart is like Swiss cheese, where there’s different holes of varying diameters that require bespoke dicks to fill them.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI did fall in love once since my divorce. I fell in love very hard with this Japanese-American dude that I met at a coffee shop, of all places. And my God, he was so stunning. I had to go and talk to him. He was 6′ 8″. Yeah, I didn’t know they made us in that size. I was like, “Oh, my God.” “Who’s this?” And then he turned out to be this very talented drummer, and a bunch of my friends knew who he was. They were like, “Oh, my God, Ali, that dude is the shit.” And he was so funny, and, my God, he was so smart. He spoke three different languages. He was a divorced dad, and we fell in love head over heels so fast. And we were getting ready to go on this big trip to Asia together, and then all of a sudden, one day, he broke up with me. And, uh… And I was totally blindsided. I still don’t know why he did it, and I was devastated. And I tried to hide how bummed out I was from my kids, but then they found me in the closet one day, listening to Tony Rich Project, They were like, “Mommy, what’s wrong? Why are you so bummed out all the time?” So that was sort of the impetus for me to get back up on stage and do stand-up again and go on tour. Um…\\n[audience cheering]\\n\\n\\n\\nYeah. Thank you so much. Stand-up is the one thing that’s always made me feel so connected to people. And I gotta tell you that even though that dude really broke my heart, not for one second did I ever regret getting divorced. I mean it. Because, you know, that drummer dude, he came along, and he filled this hole in my heart, but then he left me, and then that hole was empty again. But at least I was single and free to go on another adventure to fill it. Right? [audience cheering] Yeah. And that freedom, it feels so good. And I know that it can be really intimidating to get back out there as a 40-year-old mom, because you think to yourself, “Who’s gonna wanna fuck me and my stretched-out cave pussy?” “Who’s gonna want this geriatric uterus, these breastfed National Geographic titties?\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd I’m here to tell you that as long as you’re a kind six, real men don’t give a fuck, okay?\\n[audience cheering]\\nThey don’t. They really don’t. Real men know that real sexiness is on the inside. And I know, also, that, you know, divorce gets a really bad reputation and it can sound really scary and full of acrimony, but then just look at me as an alternate example of how it can be. I’m best friends with my ex-husband, and then if you…\\nYeah, I really am.\\n[audience cheering]\\nAnd if you can take away anything from what you’ve heard tonight, look how much fun I’m having. [audience laughing] It’s crazy. Like, I never thought I would have this much fun, this kind of fun, at this stage in my life. I swear to God, divorce is so fun… [audience laughing softly] …that I almost wanna get married again… [audience laughing] …just so I can get divorced again. And if you would like to join the hotation, please feel free to DM me. [laughing]\\n[audience laughing]\\nI’m just kidding. I have a new boyfriend now. I do. [audience cheering] Uh… I did fall in love again. Some of you might know who the guy is. [audience cheering] And, uh… it just so happens to be the man who sent me all of those flowers in Europe. I’ve been Ali Wong. Have a good night, everybody. Thank you. Thank you so much.

special falls flat with humor that feels strained and moments that drag where they should sparkle the material lacks the sharpness and rhythm that usually define her performances leaving many of the jokes feeling more like filler than punchlines her critique of dave chappelle while likely wellintentioned detracts from the overall experience coming off as more selfserving than impactful the show struggles to find its footing and what could have been a milestone performance instead leaves an impression of missed potential and underwhelming delivery\\nmichelle buteau\\u2019s comedy special a

in a good mood nothing was fazing me i felt joyful you know i was like driving us to the reptile sanctuary in the bronx in my minivan i\\u2019m not proud of that sentence  in the bronx everyone\\u2019s got road rage they\\u2019re like \\u201cmove over bitch\\u201d \\u201clearn how to park\\u201d whatever and i\\u2026 couldn\\u2019t even care\\u2026 usually i would yell back but i was just like \\u201ci hope you heal\\u201d  i was like \\u201cbeing high is wonderful\\u201d i was in the pocket i found parking or did it find us\\n\\n woo what i didn\\u2019t expect was this to be a tour we were with other people they were giving \\u201cshoes optional at walmart\\u201d  you know they were giving like thirdgeneration january   yeah you get it you know it was a lot of camouflage but i see you   but i didn\\u2019t care it was like cowboy carter i was like \\u201cthis is everyone\\u2019s america\\u201d  \\u201cthis ain\\u2019t texas\\u201d  and it was pretty interesting the most fascinating thing i learned about was a lizard called \\u201cthe bearded dragon\\u201d  it wasn\\u2019t a dragon it was more like a plussize lizard i called it lizzo  i thought it was funny people had mixed reactions just trying to be bodypositive fascinating thing about the bearded dragon is that it can change its gender and i was like \\u201cokay we\\u2019ve all had a night like that or two\\u201d\\n\\n oh well at least i have  thank you and when we walked into the bearded dragon sanctuary which is again a sentence i never thought i\\u2019d say it came right up to me and i was like \\u201cokay\\u201d and put it\\u2019s like little paw on the window i said \\u201coh here we go\\u201d everyone\\u2019s like \\u201cit likes you\\u201d i\\u2019m like \\u201ci\\u2019m a leo i have good energy\\u201d  we\\u2019re just taking our moment and we\\u2019re sort of mimicking each other becoming best friends i was there so long i felt like that white girl in that john travolta movie boy in the plastic bubble do you remember that movie no one remembers it please go home and check it out john travolta in the \\u2019 made a movie boy in the plastic bubble where he has an autoimmune disease so he has to live in a plastic bubble in his house but he has shoes on i\\u2019m like \\u201cwhere you going john\\u201d  \\u201cwhere\\u201d a lot of holes in that story not in the plastic bubble anyways\\u2026 so we\\u2019re just vibing right i\\u2019m like \\u201coh my god this is amazing\\u201d then its eyes start to roll back i was like \\u201cgo off\\u201d  and then the lizard goes \\u201ccome here\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\u201cyeah\\u201d and it says \\u201ckeep my wife\\u2019s name out your motherfucking mouth\\u201d what  they\\u2019re not even married it was wild and the

carlindave chappelleinterviewsplayboy interviewsmusichistorybooksopinions comedy michelle buteau a buteauful mind at radio city music hall   transcript january    michelle buteaus latest special falls flat with humor that feels strained and moments that drag where they should sparkle the material lacks the sharpness and rhythm that usually define her performances leaving many of the jokes feeling more like filler than punchlines her critique of dave chappelle while likely wellintentioned detracts from the overall experience coming off as more selfserving than impactful the show struggles to find its footing and what could have been a milestone performance instead leaves an impression of missed potential and underwhelming deliverymichelle buteaus comedy special a buteauful mind at radio city music hall premiered on december   and is available for streaming on netflix   dont forget brush your teeth why do i have to brush my teeth want your teeth to fall out only one of them youre

best friends are his lizards he lives with his mom for too long doesnt have a comforter just got a dusty sheet fucking monster  his favorite movie is scarface hes got the poster no frame just tacks yuck  he just got fired from jiffy lube hes got a pullup bar so his door never closes  and he never wears socks cause theyre all crunchy around his fucking floor  dont ask me how i know the reptile guy this is what ive heard my husband is just like i am not the reptile guy but i really want to go and then he hit me with this european shit when he knows how to get me to do something hes like you know it just feels like americans stop learning in school and then never want to learn  i was like how dare you be so accurate  i was like fine i will go look at lizards with you because i love you and he goes you know it might be fun if we got a little highso i took an edible but this time i only took one and it was wonderful all you have to do is just wait two hours and  minutes  and it was great i was in a good mood nothing was fazing me i felt joyful you know i was like driving us to the reptile sanctuary in the bronx in my minivan im not proud of that sentence  in the bronx everyones got road rage theyre like move over bitch learn how to park whatever and i couldnt even care usually i would yell back but i was just like i hope you heal  i was like being high is wonderful i was in the pocket i found parking or did it find us woo what i didnt expect was this to be a tour we were with other people they were giving shoes optional at walmart  you know they were giving like thirdgeneration january   yeah you get it you know it was a lot of camouflage but i see you   but i didnt care it was like cowboy carter i was like this is everyones america  this aint texas  and it was pretty interesting the most fascinating thing i learned about was a lizard called the bearded dragon  it wasnt a dragon it was more like a plussize lizard i called it lizzo  i thought it was funny people had mixed reactions just trying to be bodypositive fascinating thing about the bearded dragon is that it can change its gender and i was like okay weve all had a night like that or two oh well at least i have  thank you and when we walked into the bearded dragon sanctuary which is again a sentence i never thought id say it came right up to me and i was like okay and put its like little paw on the window i said oh here we go everyones like it likes you im like im a leo i have good energy  were just taking our moment and were sort of mimicking each other becoming best friends i was there so long i felt like that white girl in that john travolta movie boy in the plastic bubble do you remember that movie no one remembers it please go home and check it out john travolta in the  made a movie boy in the plastic bubble where he has an autoimmune disease so he has to live in a plastic bubble in his house but he has shoes on im like where you going john  where a lot of holes in that story not in the plastic bubble anyways so were just vibing right im like oh my god this is amazing then its eyes start to roll back i was like go off  and then the lizard goes come hereyeah and it says keep my wifes name out your motherfucking mouth what  theyre not even married it was wild and the tour guide was like so happy hes like she never does this she trusts you she loves you i was like she sure do but honestly right now its giving theythem okay  just being on the real real and then i heard a voice in the pack of camouflage say ah you one of them woke ones  and so you know im a little high  and i go what did you say i couldnt hear through your four good teeth  what what and she goes i asked you if you were a woke bitch  i look at my husband and i go did she just call me a bitch and he goes like this   and i said yeah i tonyaim one of them woke ones whats up i didnt mean to poke the bear but bitch dont come for me then she just started going off shes like theythem they trying to get us to say theythem all the time i was like sis you said it like seven times  you could do it you just did its fine or dont whatever i was like honestly if i can be married to someone named gijs  you can say theythem  and then she said i am so tired of this bullshit phase this nonbinary trans bullshit phase thats what she said i was like look i dont think its a phase like walking down the street living your truth as a nonbinary or trans person while you know somebody could want to hurt you or kill you is not a phase thats braveryi said yo them tattooed eyebrows on your face  thats a phase  thats not a good one you aint got no friends then she just kept coming for me im like am i on fox news is this a lowbudget laura ingraham what see why i dont want to see lizards see what i mean she just kept going on and on shes like but biology im like spell it  shes like i dont trust whats between their legs whats between their legs i dont trust whats between their legs im like why do you give a shit whats between someones legs you sound crazy if you aint feeding fucking or financing fuck off   maam she just kept going in and i just kept trying to answer her i blacked out i felt like a bigtitty george jefferson  another thing motherfucker  what am i what am i doing  im in comfy shoes to see a lizard  there was so much hate and i was like youre very blackandwhite with shit i need you to live in the shades of gray where the love and humanity existsthats what i need from you i mean a trans woman is no less of a woman even if you dont understand okay you need to love that person that is someones child  i have children i have twins my body couldnt carry them we had a surrogate im no less their mom you understand how love works like just open your minds but she kept going on and finally i was like you know what i am too cute for this conversation i was a little high now im a little sober its okay i said ill wear this outfit tomorrow cause people need to see it i walk off and then she yelled back at me and she said and to think i was gonna tell you that i loved your sweet potato casserole recipe   thank you guys so much for supporting me and being a part of

The show blends stand-up comedy and ventriloquism with a festive twist as Dunham and his cast of quirky characters reimagine \\u201cA Christmas Carol.\\u201d Highlights include Walter\\u2019s cranky takes on Christmas traditions, Bubba J\\u2019s beer-fueled holiday musings, Peanut\\u2019s chaotic antics, and Achmed\\u2019s dark humor as the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. Dunham intertwines hilarious banter, nostalgic reflections, and playful audience interactions, all while casting his characters in a potential film adaptation of the Dickens classic. With laugh-out-loud moments and a lively holiday atmosphere, Dunham delivers a unique blend of irreverence and cheer for fans of all ages.\\n* * *\\n[upbeat rock music]\\n[Bubba J] Hey, everybody!\\nIt\\u2019s the holidays!\\nA time for some joy and laughter.\\nAnd no one hands out that stuff better than your friend and mine, Jeff Dunham!\\n[audience cheering]\\nHey, hey, Milwaukee!\\n[audience cheering]\\nWelcome to my Scrooged-Up Holiday Special in the beer capital of the world.\\n[audience cheering]\\nMan, what a gorgeous theater. What a perfect place to do this.\\nMy boys have been exploring it, you know, during the day when nothing\\u2019s going on here.\\nThat third balcony is way the heck up there.\\nThat\\u2019s literally the nosebleed section. It\\u2019s awesome.\\nThey were running around, and James discovered something today that I thought was pretty great. So, he\\u2019s running around.\\nAnd because it\\u2019s the Pabst Theater, he found the \\u2018P\\u2019 on the carpet upstairs.\\nRight there. See it?\\nAnd it runs all the way, up and out\\u2026 the sides of all the runners going up and down the hallways\\nYou can see him point to it. Oh, yeah, there he is pointing to it.\\nHe thought that was very cool.\\nNo. He didn\\u2019t think it was cool. He thought it was hilarious because if you back up a little to the next photo, it spells \\u201cpoop.\\u201d\\n[audience laughing]\\nSo, why a Christmas special?\\nWell, I\\u2019m sharing with you what I know and what I grew up with.\\nI was raised in a home that celebrated Christmas, so this is a Christmas special.\\nIf I was Jewish, this would be a Hanukkah special.\\nIf I was black, this might be a Kwanzaa special.\\nIf I was an atheist, this would be a special.\\n[audience laughing]\\nBut Christmas is extra special for me, because when I was eight years-old, that year under the Christmas tree, Santa left me my very first ventriloquist dummy.\\nAnd I\\u2019ve shown this photograph before, but I have to show it again because it\\u2019s one of my favorite ones.\\nSo, under the tree is Mom and me and my first dummy and Dad, and there we are right there.\\n[audience applauding]\\n[Jeff] Thank you.\\nI think I love that picture also because you can tell how proud my father is.\\n[audience laughing]\\nBut that moment right there began a lifelong career leading to this very moment here tonight.\\nBut this special is different from any one I\\u2019ve ever done.\\nMy wife Audrey came up with the idea of me and my guys doing our own film version of the Dickens classic, A Christmas Carol.\\nI thought that would be a great movie.\\nWhy not? Let\\u2019s see if we can get it made.\\nBut then in the meantime, I thought, how about for my next stand-up special, what if it\\u2019s me talking to the guys about their possible roles in the film and what characters I think they should play.\\nSo, tonight I\\u2019m casting.\\n[audience laughing, cheering]\\nSo, if you know the Christmas Carol story, see if you can guess who of my guys should play whom in the movie.\\n[laughing]\\nYou guys ready for the little people in the boxes?\\n[audience cheering]\\n\\n\\n\\nThe first guy I\\u2019d like to introduce has been in my act a long time, and I\\u2019m fairly certain you can guess who he\\u2019d play in A Christmas Carol.\\nPlease help me welcome my old friend, Walter.\\n[audience cheering]\\nShut the hell up!\\nGood evening, Walter.\\nAnd why am I dressed like this?\\nI am hot as hell!\\nI know.\\nI think I\\u2019m having a stroke.\\nCome on.\\n[gargling sound]\\nI bet you love the holidays.\\nI bet you\\u2019re an idiot.\\nCome on. What\\u2019s your favorite Christmas carol?\\nMy favorite Christmas carol\\u2026\\nThat\\u2019s right.\\nYou mean one that makes me feel joy and hope and a beautiful peace inside?\\nThat\\u2019s right.\\n\\u201cGrandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer.\\u201d\\n[audience laughing]\\nThat\\u2019s not a Christmas carol.\\nJust imagining fills me with great joy.\\nWell, I\\u2019m happy to see you dressed for the occasion.\\nMe? I didn\\u2019t do this. You did this to me!\\nHe takes us on the tour bus and plays dolly freakin\\u2019 dress-up.\\nNo, I don\\u2019t.\\nNo one can hear us scream.\\nThat\\u2019s not true.\\nAh! He\\u2019s touching us again!\\nStop it. You look great for the occasion.\\nWhat occasion?\\nThis is our Christmas special, and this special is gonna be on Amazon Prime.\\nAmazon?\\nYeah.\\nOh, so they\\u2019re gonna deliver this special and leave it on everyone\\u2019s front porch?\\n[audience laughing]\\nInside another box that\\u2019s ten times the size it needs to be?\\n[audience laughing]\\nThen some jerk comes along and steals it off the porch, and I have to order it all over again?\\nYou know, Amazon makes things very convenient.\\nYeah, and how lazy have we gotten? I mean seriously.\\n\\u201cI need a, uh, a toothpick. I think they\\u2019re upstairs. Nah, that\\u2019s too far to walk.\\u201d\\n[audience laughing]\\n\\u201cI\\u2019ll just order it on Amazon.\\u201d\\nLet\\u2019s see. Two cents for a toothpick and 29 dollars for shipping. Done.\\n[audience laughing]\\nWalter\\u2026\\nThen, five minutes later it\\u2019s at my front door.\\nYeah.\\n\\u201cOh, look! They shipped me my toothpick in a box the size of a [bleep] Yugo.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience laughing]\\nA Yugo? That\\u2019s your reference?\\nI guess you\\u2019d prefer a Prius?\\n[audience laughing, cheering]\\nThat was a long time ago.\\nYou are forever damaged, my friend.\\nLook, our special\\u2019s gonna be on Amazon Prime, the subscription service.\\nOh, good, so we can subscribe, watch this special, then quickly unsubscribe so they won\\u2019t charge us.\\nThat\\u2019s not the best way to save money.\\nSays the guy who owned a Prius.\\n[audience laughing]\\nA blue Prius.\\n[audience laughing]\\nDoes your wife enjoy the holidays?\\nMy wife? You mean the nutcracker?\\n[audience laughing]\\nYour wife is a lovely lady, and I know that you love her very much.\\nWhatever.\\nTell everyone what you gave your wife last Christmas.\\nCOVID.\\nNo.\\n[audience laughing]\\nLook, next year there\\u2019s an idea of us filming a Christmas movie.\\nA movie?\\nYeah, I\\u2019m picking the best roles for all the guys.\\nOh, and that\\u2019s why I\\u2019m dressed like this?\\nYes.\\nSo I have to act?\\nEver done any acting?\\nSure.\\nLike what?\\nI laugh at your jokes.\\n[audience laughing]\\nThat\\u2019s not funny.\\nNo, not usually. They\\u2019re not.\\n[audience laughing]\\nWhat\\u2019s the movie?\\nA Christmas Carol.\\nAnd all of us are gonna be in it?\\nThat\\u2019s the plan.\\nAnd, uh, have you actually decided on who gets what role?\\nI\\u2019m working on that right now.\\nOkay, so you\\u2019re trying figure out who I should play?\\n[audience laughing]\\nWell, yeah.\\nSo, for me, you\\u2019ve narrowed it down to a few possible characters?\\n[audience laughing]\\nI\\u2019m a very versatile actor.\\nI\\u2019m sure.\\nI can even be that little kid who has a crutch.\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience laughing]\\nTiny Tim.\\nWhy are we suddenly talking about your\\u2026\\nOh! Oh! Oh! The kid! Tiny Tim!\\n[audience laughing]\\nI thought you were talking about your\\u2026\\nWalter\\u2026\\nTiny Tim.\\nWalter!\\nI\\u2019m sorry.\\nTiny Tim has a very important role.\\nI\\u2019m sure he does, Jeff. Good for you!\\n[audience laughing]\\nThis is a Christmas story.\\nGood place to hang the mistletoe. That\\u2019s all I\\u2019m saying.\\n[audience laughing]\\nWalter\\u2026\\nYou know, the twigs and berries.\\nWill you stop it?\\n[audience laughing]\\nOkay, back to the movie. Now, what\\u2019s that kid\\u2019s name?\\nIt\\u2019s Tiny Tim.\\nRight.\\nAnd I\\u2019m telling you\\u2026 with a little makeup, I could be that kid.\\nYou could be Tiny Tim?\\nHe\\u2019s angry, right?\\nNo.\\nOh, I think he is.\\nWhat is it he always says?\\nWell, his most famous line is, \\u201cGod\\u2026\\u201d\\nOh, yeah! \\u201cGod, why was I born? It\\u2019s a hard-knock life!\\u201d\\n[audience laughing]\\nWhat?\\nThen, he sings it, and the sun comes out tomorrow, and blahdy-blah-blah. I hate that stupid show.\\nThat\\u2019s Annie.\\nYeah.\\nAnd then Tiny Tim gets left alone at his house, and his mother yells, \\u201cKevin!\\u201d\\n[audience laughing]\\nThat\\u2019s Home Alone.\\nI could be Kevin, and you could be the guy that gets hit in the head with a box of tools and his hair catches on fire.\\n[audience laughing]\\nCan you act?\\nCan I act?\\nYou know, hang on a second.\\nWhat?\\nI don\\u2019t mean to interrupt here. I keep looking at you.\\nI don\\u2019t usually throw around compliments.\\nI just gotta say here, you know, you\\u2019re getting old, but you\\u2019re still looking pretty good.\\nDon\\u2019t you think so? He\\u2019s doing all right?\\n[audience cheering]\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you.\\nHa-ha. I\\u2019m [bleep] with ya. I\\u2019m acting.\\n[audience laughing]\\nOne of the most moving scenes in the story is near the end when Scrooge breaks down crying because he\\u2019s filled with regret. Do you think you could do that?\\nOh, sure. I\\u2019ll just pretend I\\u2019m your father.\\n[audience laughing]\\n[laughing]\\nWhat does that mean?\\nOh, come on. Think about you.\\nWhat?\\nYour father saved his entire life\\nto send his only son to a university.\\nYeah?\\nThen, you took your degree, did nothing with it, and ended up doing a puppet show.\\nHow much does that suck for your parents?\\nWalter\\u2026\\nI mean, look at what you\\u2019re doing now.\\nThis seems pretty good to me.\\nNo, not that.

Me?\\nCome on. Ebenezer Scrooge was a very rich man who never got married.\\nOh, hell yeah. I\\u2019ll be that guy.\\n[audience laughing]\\nIn the beginning of the story, Scrooge is very lonely. Do you know why?\\nHe was a ventriloquist?\\n[audience laughing]\\nSorry.\\nIn the story,\\nScrooge gets woken up three times in the middle of the night.\\nAnd it gets worse and worse the older you get.\\n[audience laughing]\\nBack then, women were expected to marry, have children, and keep a nice household.\\nAnd those were the only acceptable roles for women during that era.\\nIs that too much to ask?\\n[audience laughing]\\nAre you trying to turn off every woman in this room?\\nOh, no, no. You\\u2019ve got that covered.\\n[audience laughing]\\nHey ladies, you wanna hear a sentence that in the history of humans no woman has ever said?

The material lacks the sharpness and rhythm that usually define her performances, leaving many of the jokes feeling more like filler than punchlines. Her critique of Dave Chappelle, while likely well-intentioned, detracts from the overall experience, coming off as more self-serving than impactful. The show struggles to find its footing, and what could have been a milestone performance instead leaves an impression of missed potential and underwhelming delivery.\\nMichelle Buteau\\u2019s comedy special, A Buteau-ful Mind at Radio City Music Hall, premiered on December 31, 2024, and is available for streaming on Netflix.\\n* * *\\n[woman] Don\\u2019t forget, brush your teeth.\\n[boy] Why do I have to brush my teeth?\\n[woman] Want your teeth to fall out?\\n[boy] Only one of them.

[chuckling] But the most, like, hilarious, yet hurtful comment that I do remember, somebody was just like, \\u201cDamn\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cSis looks like the housekeeper from Get Out.\\u201d [audience laughing] [imitating the housekeeper] No! No! [wailing] No! [wailing louder] No!\\n[screaming] No!\\n[audience laughing] No! [audience laughing] [Michelle sighs] I just realized how crazy that shit is for you if you\\u2019ve never seen Get Out. [audience laughs] Like, are you okay? [audience laughs] I\\u2019m just bad at internet. I don\\u2019t know how to not care. I either shut off or I just care too much. I thought the hardest conversations I would have with my children would be around racism, being bullied, sexism, but I\\u2019m realizing, I have to figure out how to have a proper conversation with my kids, to have them define their worth without likes and followers. [audience applauds] Yes, welcome to my big-titty TED Talk, bitches. [audience laughs] With dreams as big as her shoulder pads. [crowd laughing] And, you know, my kids are so smart. I\\u2019m hoping it won\\u2019t be hard. I have five-year-old twins.\\n[crowd cheers]\\nThank you. I have boy-girl twins until they tell me otherwise, \\u2019cause Mama is inclusive. [crowd cheers] Let\\u2019s love and evolve, mother\\u2026 They have the cutest names, I think. They have family names, Hazel and Otis. So cute. I got earrings with their initials. [audience laughs] [audience cheering] That\\u2019s right. She\\u2019s a ho for life. [audience laughs] [audience applauds] Oh my goodness. Ros\\u00e9, it\\u2019s so wet. [audience laughs] I didn\\u2019t realize, with twins, everybody wants to talk to you. I didn\\u2019t know that. People, like, walk up to me with agency and purpose. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cAre they twins?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cAre you a pediatrician?\\u201d [audience laughs] But usually it\\u2019s someone that\\u2019s always a twin, and wanna tell me they\\u2019re a twin. Like, \\u201cAre they twins? I\\u2019m a twin.\\u201d \\u201cI don\\u2019t like my twin. We share a birthday cake.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThere\\u2019s a war going on.\\u201d [audience laughing] \\u201cWhat?\\u201d \\u201cWhat?\\u201d And they just stay. \\u201cYeah, my mom likes my twin better.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI see why.\\u201d [audience laughing] They keep talking. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI gotta stop you there.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m not friendly. I just have a double chin.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\n\\n\\n[Michelle chuckling] \\u201cI\\u2019m an asshole, it\\u2019s just ros\\u00e9 and butter. That\\u2019s all it is.\\u201d [crowd howling] Makes you very approachable. Gout is very approachable. [crowd titters] And I didn\\u2019t realize how different kids could be when they\\u2019re the same ingredient. They are so different. Like Hazel? Wow. Hazel has the energy of a 53-year-old Black woman that works at the DMV. [audience laughing] She is wild, she walks up in the playground, she\\u2019s like, \\u201cIs this what y\\u2019all meant to do?\\u201d [audience laughing] Hazelnut. The kids come up to me like, \\u201cMrs. Buteau, Hazel\\u2019s looking through my soul again.\\u201d [audience laughing] We got to do better. Oh my God. She\\u2019s sassy. I don\\u2019t know where she gets it from. [crowd laughs] Okay, you know what? I understand what you\\u2019re talkin\\u2019 about. However, I didn\\u2019t find my voice till I was in my 30s. She\\u2019s five. [crowd laughing] I was leaving the house one time in short sleeves to go food shopping, \\u2019cause that\\u2019s all I motherfucking do. [crowd laughing] And she said, \\u201cMama, you should put on long sleeves \\u2019cause your elbows look old.\\u201d [audience laughing] But here\\u2019s the thing, she ain\\u2019t wrong. My elbows look haunted as fuck. How? When? No one tells you about that in your 40s. It looks like I\\u2019ve been doing a plank for 22 years. [audience howling] How would I know my elbows look like the top of a pigeon\\u2019s head? When? Ladies, what all I need? Ashwagandha? What do I need? Magnesium? These elbows look crazy. My elbows look like the guy in the Indiana Jones movie, that chose the wrong cup. [audience laughing] Thank you, everybody over 38. Thank you. Thank you.\\nI see you.\\n[crowd applauds] [Michelle laughs] Oh my God, sassy children. And they don\\u2019t go to bed. They just are up all the time. She comes downstairs, 10:00 p.m. \\u201cMama, what you doing?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHiding my vape pen now. What\\u2019s good?\\u201d [audience laughing] \\u201cWhat\\u2019s up?\\u201d \\u201cYou already had two bananas. What all you need now?\\u201d [chuckles] [scoffing] My God. And sassy children, they go to bed late, they wake up early. She\\u2019s up 5:30 a.m. every day. I said, \\u201cGo back to bed, girl.\\u201d \\u201cYou ain\\u2019t missing anything.\\u201d [crowd chuckles] \\u201cThere is nothing going on right now.\\u201d \\u201cWe don\\u2019t live on a farm.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cThis is not the military.\\u201d \\u201cYou can go back to bed.\\u201d Oh my God. Hazel has so much energy. She is like\\u2026 Picture DJ Khaled as a five-year-old girl. [audience laughs] She wakes up in the morning, she\\u2019s like,\\n\\u201cGood morning, everybody!\\u201d\\n[air horn plays] [audience applauding] [audience continues applauding] [Michelle chuckles]\\n\\u266a All I do is twin, twin, twin! \\u266a\\n[air horn playing] She the best! Yeah! DJ Donwill, everybody. [audience cheers and applauds] [Michelle laughs] Oh my God. I can\\u2019t talk to Otis the way I talk to Hazel, \\u2019cause he\\u2019s so sweet and, like, quiet. Like, Hazel brings the Black mom out of me, but like a Black mom on Maury Povich. [audience laughing] Oh, baby. We be at Target, I\\u2019m like, [seething] \\u201cGet over here, girl.\\u201d \\u201cWe ain\\u2019t buying no more stuff. We ain\\u2019t buy\\u2026 Put it down!\\u201d [crowd laughs] She makes me feel like an angry ventriloquist. \\u201cGet over here!\\u201d \\u201cPut it down. I said no more stuff, we ain\\u2019t buying no more stuff.\\u201d [audience laughing] [Michelle chuckling] I can\\u2019t talk to Otis like that. Otis has the energy of a tired husband holding his wife\\u2019s purse at Macy\\u2019s. [crowd laughing] I see some of y\\u2019all in here tonight. Thank you so much. [audience chuckling] Otis is so sweet. He even blinks slow when he talks. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cMama\\u2026\\u201d [audience laughing] [audience continues laughing] [Michelle chuckles] I feel bad sometimes, because he\\u2019s growing up in a house with so much, like, strong female energy, but I\\u2019m also just like, \\u201cYou\\u2019re welcome.\\u201d [audience cheers] You know? \\u201cThat\\u2019s the best kind of education you won\\u2019t get in school.\\u201d [chuckling] I feel bad for him sometimes, his first complete sentence when he was three years old was, \\u201cOkay, everybody. Calm down.\\u201d [audience laughs] Otis! I\\u2019m trying to teach him how to be a big boy around the city, you know? Walking a New York City sidewalk, ride the subway, the train. Hold the door open for old people, all that shit. It\\u2019s important. And we were on a very crowded corner one time in New York City, and he yells in front of everybody, \\u201cMama, the blinking hand said we can\\u2019t go now!\\u201d I said, \\u201cThat\\u2019s right, baby.\\u201d And then strangers were just like, \\u201cGood job, Mama.\\u201d \\u201cGood job\\u2026\\u201d And parents know when your kid does something right in public, you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI am a fucking angel.\\u201d [audience laughing] \\u201cI am a walking angel. What are you childless fucks doing? Recycling? Okay.\\u201d \\u201cOkay.\\u201d \\u201cComposting? Okay.\\u201d We are leaving it better than how we found it. Otis caught wind, and he was very proud of himself. And so then he yells, \\u201cMama, the white man said we can go now!\\u201d\\n[audience laughing]\\n[audience continues laughing]\\nOh my God. So I call this story \\u201cBirth Control.\\u201d \\u2018Cause if you were thinking about having a kid, listen to this and decide. [crowd laughs] Otis had a big booger in his nose. A big booger and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cMama, how do I get this out?\\u201d Like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s a real question?\\u201d Know when your kid says something you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI\\u2019m worried for the rest of your life\\u201d? [crowd laughing] I said, \\u201cPut your finger in there, dig like you\\u2019re looking for an answer.\\u201d [audience chuckles] What am I, Mr. Rogers? I don\\u2019t know. He had a hard time getting it. I was like, \\u201cOtis, this is hard to watch.\\u201d [audience laughing] \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna be honest with ya.\\u201d His head was leaning back. Chasing himself like a dog chasing his tail. I was like, \\u201cThis is not how I want to remember you, you know?\\u201d [crowd laughs] He\\u2019s like, \\u201cMama, I can\\u2019t get it.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI see that.\\u201d I should also mention we were boarding a flight. [audience laughs] [Michelle chuckles] And he said, \\u201cMama, I can\\u2019t get it.\\u201d And so, I made a decision. I went in there and I got it. [crowd laughs] And then he did a move I\\u2019ve never seen a human body do. He folded like a beach chair. [crowd laughs] Laid out on the floor. He was like\\u2026 [squeaking sounds] And then laid. What? And lay down. And then he yelled\\u2026 [chuckling] \\u201cMama, I want to get my booger!\\u201d And then he says, \\u201cPut it back.\\u201d [audience laughs] And there were people behind me. And I had a decision to make. So I put it back. [audience laughing and groaning] [scattered applause] See, half y\\u2019all clap and half y\\u2019all judge, and I see that shit. Okay? That\\u2019s how people looked at me. I wanted to yell at them, like, \\u201cI used to be cool, okay?\\u201d \\u201cI was cool. I\\u2019ve done cocaine off of a dick, I know how complicated noses can be, bitch.\\u201d \\u201cEnjoy your overhead space.\\u201d\\n[scattered cheering and clapping]\\n[Michelle chuckling] It\\u2019s a good time to give my mom a shout-out in the audience.\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\nHi, Mom. Hi, Marie. [chuckles] Oh man, I must have been a sassy kid, \\u2019cause I feel her bone density be different. [crowd laughs] Like, I get it now, you know? I don\\u2019t like to complain, but I feel run-down, y\\u2019all. You know, like, don\\u2019t let the sequence and tulle fool you. [crowd laughs] I am run-down, like, if you come to my house, 5:30 every night, you can catch me on the couch, and I am serving Viola Davis tired. [audience laughs] [puffing and panting] [labored breathing] [imitating Viola Davis] \\u201cI\\u2019m so tired.\\u201d [fake crying] [gasps] [normal voice] So tired. Now I know why my mom looks like that. [audience chuckling] My mom looks like a husky dog in Miami, like\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know if she\\u2019s thirsty or smiling, it\\u2019s just\\u2026 [audience laughing] [panting heavily] [huffs] She always looks like she\\u2019s asking the question and answering it, like\\u2026 [audience laughing] [Michelle panting heavily] Now I get it. Now I get it. I feel like the door at the end of the movie Titanic.\\n[audience laughing]\\nJust, like, less buoyant, and everyone\\u2019s climbing on. My whole family is trying to take a seat. [crowd chuckling] And my whistle won\\u2019t work, I\\u2019m like\\u2026 [blows a raspberry] [keeps blowing a raspberry] [blows a raspberry harder] [blows a faint raspberry] [audience tittering] I get it! I get it. I didn\\u2019t even realize, like, you could hurt yourself when you\\u2019re taking care of kids, \\u2019cause you\\u2019re not thinking about how you move your body. And I hurt myself \\u2019cause I\\u2019m bending over all the time, and not in the way I like. Air horn! [air horn sound plays] [audience applauding] [chuckling] Thank you. I hurt myself real bad one time. And my husband was like, \\u201cI think you got sciatica.\\u201d And I didn\\u2019t even know what it was. That\\u2019s how young I was. [audience laughs] I thought it was an overpriced pasta. [audience laughs] He said, \\u201cI think it\\u2019s sciatica.\\u201d I said, \\u201cCheck the receipt. It\\u2019s Penne Pomodoro.\\u201d [audience laughs] That\\u2019s how young I was. Make some noise if you know what sciatica is.\\n[audience cheers]\\nYes! I love a grown crowd. Thanks for keeping your muscles in check. \\u201cI can\\u2019t come to the show tonight.\\u201d \\u201cMy sciatica is picking up right now.\\u201d Oh my God, I have readers now, what? I can\\u2019t see a menu. I\\u2019m that bitch. \\u201cTurn your light on.\\u201d [crowd laughs] \\u201cWhy are these restaurants so dark?\\u201d [audience laughs] I\\u2019m this old. [audience laughs] Oh my God, I hurt myself with the sciatica and I went to the doctor. He gave me athlete\\u2019s-grade ibuprofen. I was like, \\u201cYes, I am an athlete, good job.\\u201d [crowd chuckling] And he gave me a Theragun. Y\\u2019all know what a Theragun is? [cheers] Awesome. I didn\\u2019t know. I was like, \\u201cOkay, massage gun helping me out through the day.\\u201d \\u201cCome on.\\u201d And I couldn\\u2019t go nowhere, so I had a friend over and she happens to be a beautiful Black lesbian. I call her \\u201cThe Oracle.\\u201d [crowd laughing] She ever-knowing and glowing. And she saw my Theragun on my table and she goes, \\u201cOkay.\\u201d [audience laughs] I said, \\u201cGirl, that\\u2019s for my sciatica.\\u201d And she\\u2019s like, \\u201cWhatever.\\u201d [crowd howling] I said, \\u201cGirl, it\\u2019s my Theragun.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s got the word \\u2018gun\\u2019 in it.\\u201d And she said, \\u201cDepends where you point it.\\u201d [audience laughs] [Michelle chuckles] I said, \\u201cGirl.\\u201d She said, \\u201cGirl, what?\\u201d I said, \\u201cGirl, you stop.\\u201d She said, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I looked at her, I said, \\u201cGirl.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\u201cYou like to get your pussy beat up like that?\\u201d [audience laughing] [woman] Woo!

You think you know somebody. Can I just recap what had happened right now? I told y\\u2019all a true-ass story about my beautiful Black lesbian friend. And a little bit of violence on a puss. Nothing crazy, a dollop will do you. [crowd laughs] And for the most part, we laughed. Some of y\\u2019all were judging. Some of y\\u2019all were curious. [audience laughs] You don\\u2019t see what I see. [audience laughing] [Michelle chuckles] But all I\\u2019m saying is it can be done. It can be done, we can tell jokes and stories and not disparage a whole community. We can do that. We can make it funny.\\nWe just have to work at it, right?\\n[applause]\\nSo if you ever run into Dave Chappelle, can you let him know that shit?\\n[audience cheers loudly]\\nI don\\u2019t think he know that shit. I don\\u2019t think we\\u2019ll run into Dave, \\u2019cause he\\u2019s the GOAT. And he is the GOAT, if that means going off about trans people. Dave. It\\u2019s not funny. It\\u2019s dangerous. Make it funny.\\n[audience cheering and applauding]\\n[Michelle] That\\u2019s all. I can\\u2019t believe somebody would make millions of dollars for making people feel unsafe.\\nThat is so wild to me, like\\u2026 Truly.\\n[crowd cheers]\\n[crowd cheers and claps]\\nI\\u2019m manifesting this shit tonight, this is a Radio City Music Hall takeover, and I\\u2019m gonna tell everybody, I wanna make millions and millions of dollars for making people feel safe, seen, secure, heard, and entertained. Entertained.\\nEntertaining.\\n[crowd cheers]\\nWhat are we doing? That is my goal. My goal used to be to find my belly button when I sit down, but that shit ain\\u2019t realistic. [crowd laughs] Girl, set yourself up for success. [audience laughs] Just have some goals. I just don\\u2019t know why people aren\\u2019t doing it anymore. You know? Say you do the thing, and then do the thing.\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\nThat\\u2019s all. Like my friends that are, like, stuck. Right? Always dating the wrong person. The way you do one thing is the way you do everything. Right? If you were in the theater tonight, dating somebody that\\u2019s not good for you, especially the ladies, don\\u2019t do it no more. Leave here tonight and unfollow that motherfucker.\\nThat\\u2019s energy you don\\u2019t have.\\n[audience applauds]\\nOkay? And I\\u2019m not a chiropractor, but you ain\\u2019t gonna be wet forever, sis. [audience laughs] God. It is a journey, though. You got to really, like, find the right one, you know? I\\u2019ve fucked a lot of frogs. [audience laughs] It was like a frog farm. [crowd laughing] I\\u2019m so glad I found the right one.\\nIt\\u2019s so nice.\\n[crowd applauds]\\nIt really is. When people meet me and my husband, they\\u2019re like, \\u201cWow, you guys like each other.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYou\\u2019re supposed to.\\u201d Why be with somebody you don\\u2019t like? That is what your family is for.\\n[audience laughing]\\n[Michelle chuckles] Hello? But I also think it\\u2019s important to, like, name the good time and name the bad times, that\\u2019s okay. The hardest time my husband and I had definitely was the pandemic. I didn\\u2019t get how social we were until we were together all\\u2026 the fucking time. [crowd laughs] I would move to another room, he\\u2019d follow me. I\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s up?\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cWhat\\u2019s up?\\u201d His stories were terrible.

I started using this tone with him that I\\u2019d never used with anybody before. It\\u2019s like the tone you use when Alexa ain\\u2019t playing your song. [audience laughs] You know that tone? I was like, [yelling] \\u201cNo. I. Said\\u2026\\u201d [normal voice] What? Why am I talking to him like that? I love him. [woman howling] Name the good, name the bad. That\\u2019s how you get over it, celebrate it. Honestly, like, what I love about me and my husband is that we\\u2019re real partners, right? Like, we celebrate each other\\u2019s wins. And if you\\u2019re with someone who\\u2019s jealous of you, they don\\u2019t understand your power because they\\u2019re not in their power.\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\nOh my goodness. Look at me, shoulder pads. Dropping some wisdom. Where\\u2019s the donation basket? Come on, now. [audience laughs] [Michelle chuckles] Truly, we celebrate shit. I celebrate the small things. You got to, otherwise you have nothing to celebrate. I\\u2019ll pop a bottle of champagne on Wednesday \\u2019cause I paid a parking ticket. [crowd cheers] That\\u2019s how I\\u2019m living. That\\u2019s what I\\u2019m doing. Oh my God. And my husband threw me a party during the pandemic just for me. Because we found out Lenny Kravitz followed me on Instagram.\\n[audience cheering and applauding]\\n[cheering swells]\\n\\n\\n\\n[Michelle] What? What? Crazy, I came downstairs with streamers and balloons. My husband\\u2019s on the table, like, \\u266a American woman! \\u266a [audience laughing] I said, \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna suck it right off.\\u201d [audience applauding and cheering] [Michelle chuckles] [cheers subside] Happy for each other. But then Lenny Kravitz keep liking my posts. My husband went, \\u201cDo I got to worry about Lenny Kravitz?\\u201d [audience laughs] I said, \\u201cYes, you do.\\u201d [audience cheers] \\u201cYes, you do.\\u201d \\u201cNow clean them spoons, honey. I heard we ain\\u2019t got no clean spoons.\\u201d [audience laughs] Bitch. [laughter continues] My husband\\u2019s really into fixing stuff now. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cLet\\u2019s fix something.\\u201d I said, \\u201cI\\u2019m okay.\\u201d [scoffs] \\u201cYou fix it. You tell me, I will listen.\\u201d Do you know this man came home with a chair from the garbage? [audience laughs] [audience giggles] I said, \\u201cWho this for?\\u201d [crowd laughs] [Michelle scoffs] He was like, \\u201cI was hoping we could fix it.\\u201d I said, \\u201cNo, thanks.\\u201d He\\u2019s like, \\u201cI wanna fix something with you.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat about voter suppression?\\u201d [audience laughing]\\n\\u201cCan we do that?\\u201d\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\nWe like to have fun, though. He\\u2019s really good at being high. [audience laughs] It don\\u2019t matter how much or little he has, he\\u2019s like, \\u201cI\\u2019m cool, man.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m cool. Need help? Let me help you with those bags.\\u201d Like, he\\u2019s so cool. Nothing gets to him. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay. It happens.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d Like, me, I\\u2019m not good at being high. I want to be good at it. I am not, you know? I want\\u2026 I want to serve, like, plus-size Erykah Badu, but\\u2026 [audience laughs] It ain\\u2019t, it\\u2019s serving plus-size crackhead, real talk. Ooh, baby, if you ever saw me in the street high, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry, I\\u2019m high. Did you know I was high? Are my eyes red?\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m so sorry, I\\u2019m high!\\u201d [trilling] \\u201cWoo!\\u201d \\u201cIs it game night? What are we doing?\\u201d \\u201cFold laundry? Clean the fridge? Do push-ups?\\u201d \\u201cWhat should we do? I am high!\\u201d \\u201cWow!\\u201d [scattered laughing] It\\u2019s not good. It\\u2019s not a good look. My husband and I had a date night. One night, I got tickets to the Knicks game, which is a basketball team. [audience cheering] That\\u2019s right, honey. We had courtside seats.\\n[crowd cheers]\\nYeah, he was very excited. I was like, \\u201cI\\u2019m good.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know about basketball.\\u201d He\\u2019s like, \\u201cIt\\u2019ll be fun.\\u201d I said, \\u201cYou should go with somebody.\\u201d He\\u2019s like, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s our date night. We should go.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI guess.\\u201d [audience laughs] He\\u2019s like, \\u201cIt\\u2019d be fun if we got high.\\u201d [audience laughing] [laughter swells] I said, \\u201cOkay.\\u201d [crowd laughing] He gave me a little piece of edible. Nothing\\u2026 Nothing crazy. I didn\\u2019t feel anything 40 minutes later, so I was like, \\u201cCan I have a little more?\\u201d [audience groaning] [audience laughing] Everybody knows but me! [crowd laughs] There\\u2019s no instructions on the side. [audience laughing] [Michelle] Woo! I\\u2019ll tell you what. We got to that game, I was holding on to my chair with two hands. [audience howling] [crowd continues laughing] \\u201cWow\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cWow\\u2026\\u201d\\n\\u201cWow.\\u201d\\n[crowd laughs] [softly] \\u201cWow.\\u201d Like, I don\\u2019t know if you guys have ever seen a kite with freckles and big hair. [audience laughing] That was me. [crowd laughs] Like, I didn\\u2019t know if I was talking to myself out loud, or if it was an inside voice. [crowd laughs] [hoarsely] She was out here. I was like, \\u201cWow.\\u201d\\nI was like, \\u266a Butterfly in the sky \\u266a\\n[audience cheers and laughs]\\n\\u266a I feel twice as high \\u266a\\n\\u266a Take a look \\u266a\\n[audience] \\u266a It\\u2019s in a book \\u266a \\u266a A Reading Rainbow \\u266a\\nYeah! [audience cheers and applauds]\\n[woman] Woo!\\nOh my goodness. I was nice, nice. [woman chuckles] And then the game started. [crowd laughs] [exhales] Then the paranoia set in. [audience laughs] The announcer was just so\\u2026 loud. [crowd laughing] I was shook, it felt like Cloverfield. I was like\\u2026 \\u201cWe got to go.\\u201d\\nHe was like\\u2026 [inaudible shouting]\\n[air horn sound plays] [audience laughing] Then the players came out, I was like, \\u201cWe are not safe.\\u201d [audience laughs] [laughing continues] They were so tall. [crowd laughs] It was all Adam\\u2019s apples and kneecaps. [audience laughing] They look like Sigourney Weaver as an Avatar. I was like, \\u201cNo.\\u201d [audience laughing] \\u201cNo, thank you.\\u201d I tried to get my husband\\u2019s attention like, [whispers] \\u201cBaby.\\u201d [straining] \\u201cBaby.\\u201d\\n[moaning] \\u201cBaby.\\u201d\\n[audience laughing] He\\u2019s like, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s up? Why you whispering?\\u201d I said, \\u201c\\u2018Cause the players can hear me.\\u201d [audience laughing] I said, \\u201cWe got to go.\\u201d He\\u2019s like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s been eight minutes.\\u201d [audience laughing] I said, \\u201cI\\u2019m really sorry, but we got to go.\\u201d \\u201cI am very high.\\u201d [audience laughs] And this is why I love my husband. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay, baby.\\u201d \\u201cJust enjoy it.\\u201d \\u201cJust enjoy the ride.\\u201d \\u201cRide the wave.\\u201d \\u201cTaste the rainbow.\\u201d [audience laughs] He\\u2019s like, \\u201cJust focus on something, and just like it.\\u201d \\u201cOkay?\\u201d All positive vibes. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cNo one can hear you.\\u201d \\u201cAnymore.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\nAnd so, I actually did see a car\\u2026 in the corner of the court. And this car was beautiful, the lights were on. It was, like, going around in a circle. And I was like, \\u201cThat is really nice. Like\\u2026 \\u201d \\u201cI wonder who\\u2019s going to get it.\\u201d [crowd laughs] \\u201cWhere do they live? What kind of life will they have?\\u201d \\u201cAre they gonna put the Christmas tree on top?\\u201d Then I asked my husband, I was like, \\u201cBaby, when do we find out who wins the car?\\u201d [audience laughs] He was like, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d [audience laughing] I said, \\u201cWhen do we find out who wins the car?\\u201d And he goes, \\u201cBaby, no one\\u2019s going to win it.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d He\\u2019s like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s advertising, it\\u2019s not Family Feud, girl.\\u201d [audience laughing] And then I started to cry. [audience howling] I was like, \\u201cLife ain\\u2019t fair.\\u201d [crowd laughs] And then he\\u2019s like, \\u201cBaby, I think we should go.\\u201d I said, \\u201cI think we should go.\\u201d [audience laughing] But can I tell y\\u2019all, as soon as we both agreed we should go, they put me on the celeb cam. [audience laughs] I didn\\u2019t know what to do, so I was just serving, like, seventh-grade talent show. What?\\n[\\u201cEverybody Dance Now\\u201d plays]\\nTurn it up, turn it up!\\n\\u266a Give me the music \\u266a\\n\\u266a Everybody dance now \\u266a\\nThat\\u2019s good. Cut it, cut it, cut it.\\n[song stops]\\n[audience cheering]\\nHit it!\\n[\\u201cEverybody Dance Now\\u201d plays]\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\n\\u266a Everybody dance now \\u266a\\n\\u266a Yeah \\u266a\\n\\u266a Yeah \\u266a\\n[audience cheers]\\nKill it!\\n[audience roars]\\n[music fades] [audience applauds] [woman] Woo! [audience laughing] Hit it! [\\u201cEverybody Dance Now\\u201d playing] [song fades] [chuckles] Oh my God. I rea\\u2013 [laughing] Yo\\u2026 [laughing] [audience laughs] [audience cheering and applauding] I was like a Dominican Forrest Gump. Like\\u2026 [audience howling] I bachata\\u2019d my way out that fucking game. It was giving fight or flight realness. [crowd laughs] So\\u2026 about that story. [laughs] [crowd laughs] That\\u2019s the last time we did a date night. [audience laughs] And that\\u2019s okay, you know, I\\u2019m\\u2026 I\\u2019m a mom. I\\u2019m a working bitch. Like, I\\u2019m just tired, like\\u2026 You know, once I start hitting that Viola Davis like\\u2026 [panting and coughing] [crowd laughing] Give me the ros\\u00e9, put me to bed. So my husband and I have actually graduated to day dates. Is anybody that old? [crowd applauds] Responsible adult. Ooh, baby. Day dates are amazing. It\\u2019s exactly what it sounds like, a date during the day. Go to a restaurant you can\\u2019t get into Saturday night on Monday afternoon. [audience laughing] You got a prix fixe menu, you taste everything for $45. [audience laughs] [Michelle laughs] Have some wine. Go home in the afternoon, sit and spin on that dick. [audience laughing] Take a shower, get the hot spots, pick the kids up from school in a good-ass mood! [crowd laughing] Oh, I\\u2019m sorry, half of y\\u2019all picking your kids up smelling like badussy? [audience laughing] [audience chuckling] Okay. [Michelle laughs] My husband surprised me with this day date and\\u2026 [sighs] Yes, he is white, but this\\u2026 I don\\u2019t want to say this is about race, but this is the whitest shit I\\u2019ve ever heard. Who is white here, in the front? Thank you so much. What\\u2019s your name?\\nPearl.\\nPearl?\\nCome on.\\n[audience laughs] Pearl? Didn\\u2019t expect you\\u2019d have the whitest, oldest name. [audience laughs] I love your grandma. Okay, Pearl. You tell me if this is white as fuck. And you got be like, \\u201cThat is white as fuck.\\u201d Okay? My husband came home, and he said, \\u201cBaby, I got us two tickets to a reptile sanctuary.\\u201d [crowd laughs] Pearl.\\nThat\\u2019s white as fuck.\\nWhite as fuck. Thank you. [audience laughing and applauding] So I told him, I was like, \\u201cBaby, I can\\u2019t go to a reptile sanctuary.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s\\u2013 that\\u2019s crazy.\\u201d He\\u2019s like, \\u201cWe gotta go, the tickets were cheap.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYou pay?\\u201d [audience laughing] \\u201cThey should be paying us.\\u201d [crowd chuckling] I looked at him, I was like, \\u201cAre you the reptile guy?\\u201d \\u201cI married the reptile guy?\\u201d He\\u2019s like, \\u201cThe reptile guy?\\u201d I said, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t know the reptile guy?\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s the guy whose, like, best friends are his lizards.\\u201d \\u201cHe lives with his mom for too long.\\u201d \\u201cDoesn\\u2019t have a comforter. Just got a dusty sheet, fucking monster.\\u201d [audience chucking] \\u201cHis favorite movie is Scarface. He\\u2019s got the poster.\\u201d \\u201cNo frame, just tacks? Yuck.\\u201d [audience laughing] \\u201cHe just got fired from Jiffy Lube, he\\u2019s got a pull-up bar so his door never closes.\\u201d [crowd chuckling] \\u201cAnd he never wears socks \\u2019cause they\\u2019re all crunchy around his fucking floor.\\u201d [audience laughs and groans] Don\\u2019t ask me how I know the reptile guy. This is what I\\u2019ve heard. My husband is just like, \\u201cI am not the reptile guy, but I really want to go.\\u201d And then he hit me with this European shit when he knows how to get me to do something. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cYou know, it just feels like Americans stop learning in school and then never want to learn.\\u201d [audience groaning] I was like, \\u201cHow dare you be so accurate?\\u201d [audience laughing] I was like, \\u201cFine. I will go look at lizards with you.\\u201d \\u201cBecause I love you.\\u201d And he goes, \\u201cYou know, it might be fun if we got a little high.\\u201d\\n[audience laughing]\\nSo I took an edible. But this time, I only took one. And it was wonderful. All you have to do is just wait two hours and 17 minutes. [crowd roaring] And it was great. I was in a good mood. Nothing was fazing me. I felt joyful. You know, I was, like, driving us to the reptile sanctuary in the Bronx in my minivan. I\\u2019m not proud of that sentence. [audience chuckling] In the Bronx, everyone\\u2019s got road rage. They\\u2019re, like, \\u201cMove over, bitch.\\u201d \\u201cLearn how to park.\\u201d Whatever, and I\\u2026 couldn\\u2019t even care\\u2026 Usually I would yell back, but I was just, like, \\u201cI hope you heal.\\u201d [audience laughing] I was like, \\u201cBeing high is wonderful.\\u201d I was in the pocket. I found parking. Or did it find us?\\n[audience laughing]\\n[Michelle] Woo! What I didn\\u2019t expect was this to be a tour. We were with other people. They were giving, \\u201cShoes optional at Walmart.\\u201d [audience laughing and groaning] You know? They were giving, like, third-generation January 6. [crowd chuckling and groaning] Yeah. You get it. You know, it was a lot of camouflage, but I see you. [audience laughing] [scattered applause] But I didn\\u2019t care. It was like Cowboy Carter. I was like, \\u201cThis is everyone\\u2019s America.\\u201d [crowd laughing] \\u201cThis ain\\u2019t Texas.\\u201d [Michelle chuckling] And it was pretty interesting. The most fascinating thing I learned about was a lizard called \\u201cthe bearded dragon.\\u201d [audience laughs] It wasn\\u2019t a dragon, it was more like a plus-size lizard, I called it Lizzo. [crowd laughing] I thought it was funny, people had mixed reactions. Just trying to be body-positive. Fascinating thing about the bearded dragon is that it can change its gender. And I was like, \\u201cOkay. We\\u2019ve all had a night like that or two.\\u201d\\n[Michelle chuckles]\\n[crowd laughs] Oh, well, at least I have. [audience laughing and whistling] Thank you. And when we walked into the bearded dragon sanctuary, which is again, a sentence I never thought I\\u2019d say, it came right up to me, and I was like, \\u201cOkay.\\u201d And put it\\u2019s, like, little paw on the window. I said, \\u201cOh, here we go.\\u201d Everyone\\u2019s like, \\u201cIt likes you.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI\\u2019m a Leo. I have good energy.\\u201d [audience laughing] We\\u2019re just taking our moment, and we\\u2019re sort of mimicking each other, becoming best friends. I was there so long, I felt like that white girl in that John Travolta movie, Boy in the Plastic Bubble. Do you remember that movie? No one remembers it. Please go home and check it out. John Travolta, in the \\u201970s, made a movie, Boy in the Plastic Bubble, where he has an autoimmune disease. So he has to live in a plastic bubble in his house. But he has shoes on. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhere you going, John?\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cWhere?\\u201d A lot of holes in that story, not in the plastic bubble, anyways\\u2026 So we\\u2019re just vibing, right? I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my God, this is amazing.\\u201d Then its eyes start to roll back. I was like, \\u201cGo off.\\u201d [crowd laughing] And then the lizard goes, \\u201cCome here.\\u201d\\n[audience laughing]\\n[audience continues laughing]\\n\\u201cYeah?\\u201d And it says, \\u201cKeep my wife\\u2019s name out your motherfucking mouth.\\u201d What? [audience roaring] They\\u2019re not even married! It was wild, and the tour guide was, like, so happy. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cShe never does this. She trusts you, she loves you.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cShe sure do, but honestly, right now, it\\u2019s giving they/them, okay?\\u201d [crowd laughing] Just being on the real, real. And then I heard a voice in the pack of camouflage, say\\u2026 \\u201cAh,\\u201d \\u201cYou one of them woke ones?\\u201d [crowd hooting] And so, you know, I\\u2019m a little high. [audience chuckling] And I go, \\u201cWhat did you say?\\u201d \\u201cI couldn\\u2019t hear through your four good teeth.\\u201d [audience laughing and applauding] \\u201cWhat?\\u201d \\u201cWhat?\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cI asked you if you were a woke bitch.\\u201d [crowd gasping] I look at my husband and I go, \\u201cDid she just call me a bitch?\\u201d And he goes like this\\u2026 [audience laughing] [laughter swells] And I said, \\u201cYeah, I, Tonya.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience laughs and groans]\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m one of them woke ones. What\\u2019s up?\\u201d I didn\\u2019t mean to poke the bear, but bitch, don\\u2019t come for me. Then she just started going off. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cThey/them. They trying to get us to say \\u2018they/them\\u2019 all the time.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cSis, you said it, like, seven times.\\u201d [audience laughing] \\u201cYou could do it. You just did. It\\u2019s fine.\\u201d \\u201cOr don\\u2019t, whatever.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cHonestly, if I can be married to someone named \\u2018Gijs\\u2019\\u2026 [crowd laughs] \\u2026you can say \\u2018they/them.'\\u201d [audience laughing] And then she said, \\u201cI am so tired of this bullshit phase, this non-binary, trans bullshit phase.\\u201d That\\u2019s what she said. I was like, \\u201cLook, I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s a phase.\\u201d \\u201cLike, walking down the street, living your truth as a non-binary or trans person, while you know somebody could want to hurt you or kill you is not a phase, that\\u2019s bravery.\\u201d\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\nI said, \\u201cYo.\\u201d \\u201cThem tattooed eyebrows on your face?\\u201d [crowd laughs] \\u201cThat\\u2019s a phase.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cThat\\u2019s not a good one. You ain\\u2019t got no friends?\\u201d Then she just kept coming for me. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cAm I on Fox News?\\u201d \\u201cIs this a low-budget Laura Ingraham? What\\u2026\\u201d See why I don\\u2019t want to see lizards? See what I mean? She just kept going on and on. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cBut biology.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cSpell it.\\u201d [audience laughing] She\\u2019s like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t trust what\\u2019s between their legs.\\u201d \\u201cWhat\\u2019s between their legs? I don\\u2019t trust what\\u2019s between their legs.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhy do you give a shit what\\u2019s between someone\\u2019s legs?\\u201d \\u201cYou sound crazy. If you ain\\u2019t feeding, fucking, or financing, fuck off.\\u201d [audience cheers and applauds] [Michelle] \\u201cMa\\u2019am.\\u201d She just kept going in, and I just kept trying to answer her. I blacked out. I felt like a big-titty George Jefferson. [imitating George Jefferson] \\u201cAnother thing, motherfucker!\\u201d [normal voice] What am I\\u2026 What am I doing? [Michelle snickering] I\\u2019m in comfy shoes to see a lizard. [crowd chuckles] There was so much hate, and I was like, \\u201cYou\\u2019re very black-and-white with shit.\\u201d \\u201cI need you to live in the shades of gray where the love and humanity exists.\\u201d\\n[audience cheering and applauding]\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s what I need from you.\\u201d \\u201cI mean, a trans woman is no less of a woman, even if you don\\u2019t understand, okay?\\u201d \\u201cYou need to love that person. That is someone\\u2019s child.\\u201d [crowd applauds] \\u201cI have children. I have twins. My body couldn\\u2019t carry them.\\u201d \\u201cWe had a surrogate. I\\u2019m no less their mom.\\u201d \\u201cYou understand how love works?\\u201d \\u201cLike, just open your minds.\\u201d But she kept going on, and finally, I was like, \\u201cYou know what?\\u201d \\u201cI am too cute for this conversation.\\u201d I was a little high, now I\\u2019m a little sober, it\\u2019s okay. I said, \\u201cI\\u2019ll wear this outfit tomorrow \\u2019cause people need to see it.\\u201d I walk off. And then she yelled back at me, and she said, \\u201cAnd to think, I was gonna tell you that I loved your sweet potato casserole recipe!\\u201d [air horn plays] [audience cheering] Thank you, guys, so much for supporting me and being a part of history tonight.

Kind of a deeper, mouth-open kind of thing. Went up the back of the thing, snapped the fucking bra. Pulled the bra out, whipped it on the ground, got the hands rolling. The belt line, then got the hand in, went some buns. A little bun-smacking, went down the middle, finger tapping and shit.

My wife\\u2019s eight years younger than me. That was fine when we were young, because\\u2026 now that we\\u2019re older, she still looks good, I\\u2019m starting to look a little beaten. Know what I mean? And I don\\u2019t wanna\\u2026 I don\\u2019t want to do plastic surgery. I\\u2019ll never do that. I did try Botox\\u2026 on my dick. I Botoxed my dick.

My dick was starting to get a little\\u2026 a little worn-looking. You know, a little\\u2026 Almost like it needed a cane. It was always kind of leaning. Scoliosis dick.

That\\u2019s why God gave you wrinkles for a reason. Pull your pants down, a girl sees. You go, \\u201cNo, it gets better than that.\\u201d \\u201cYou just gotta wait.\\u201d Anyways, I took the wrinkles away. I\\u2019m in the fucking, goddamn, uh, YMCA locker room. I\\u2019m naked.

The show blends stand-up comedy and ventriloquism with a festive twist as Dunham and his cast of quirky characters reimagine \\u201cA Christmas Carol.\\u201d Highlights include Walter\\u2019s cranky takes on Christmas traditions, Bubba J\\u2019s beer-fueled holiday musings, Peanut\\u2019s chaotic antics, and Achmed\\u2019s dark humor as the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. Dunham intertwines hilarious banter, nostalgic reflections, and playful audience interactions, all while casting his characters in a potential film adaptation of the Dickens classic. With laugh-out-loud moments and a lively holiday atmosphere, Dunham delivers a unique blend of irreverence and cheer for fans of all ages.\\n* * *\\n[upbeat rock music]\\n[Bubba J] Hey, everybody!\\nIt\\u2019s the holidays!\\nA time for some joy and laughter.\\nAnd no one hands out that stuff better than your friend and mine, Jeff Dunham!\\n[audience cheering]\\nHey, hey, Milwaukee!\\n[audience cheering]\\nWelcome to my Scrooged-Up Holiday Special in the beer capital of the world.\\n[audience cheering]\\nMan, what a gorgeous theater. What a perfect place to do this.\\nMy boys have been exploring it, you know, during the day when nothing\\u2019s going on here.\\nThat third balcony is way the heck up there.\\nThat\\u2019s literally the nosebleed section. It\\u2019s awesome.\\nThey were running around, and James discovered something today that I thought was pretty great. So, he\\u2019s running around.\\nAnd because it\\u2019s the Pabst Theater, he found the \\u2018P\\u2019 on the carpet upstairs.\\nRight there. See it?\\nAnd it runs all the way, up and out\\u2026 the sides of all the runners going up and down the hallways\\nYou can see him point to it. Oh, yeah, there he is pointing to it.\\nHe thought that was very cool.\\nNo. He didn\\u2019t think it was cool. He thought it was hilarious because if you back up a little to the next photo, it spells \\u201cpoop.\\u201d\\n[audience laughing]\\nSo, why a Christmas special?\\nWell, I\\u2019m sharing with you what I know and what I grew up with.\\nI was raised in a home that celebrated Christmas, so this is a Christmas special.\\nIf I was Jewish, this would be a Hanukkah special.\\nIf I was black, this might be a Kwanzaa special.\\nIf I was an atheist, this would be a special.\\n[audience laughing]\\nBut Christmas is extra special for me, because when I was eight years-old, that year under the Christmas tree, Santa left me my very first ventriloquist dummy.\\nAnd I\\u2019ve shown this photograph before, but I have to show it again because it\\u2019s one of my favorite ones.\\nSo, under the tree is Mom and me and my first dummy and Dad, and there we are right there.\\n[audience applauding]\\n[Jeff] Thank you.\\nI think I love that picture also because you can tell how proud my father is.\\n[audience laughing]\\nBut that moment right there began a lifelong career leading to this very moment here tonight.\\nBut this special is different from any one I\\u2019ve ever done.\\nMy wife Audrey came up with the idea of me and my guys doing our own film version of the Dickens classic, A Christmas Carol.\\nI thought that would be a great movie.\\nWhy not? Let\\u2019s see if we can get it made.\\nBut then in the meantime, I thought, how about for my next stand-up special, what if it\\u2019s me talking to the guys about their possible roles in the film and what characters I think they should play.\\nSo, tonight I\\u2019m casting.\\n[audience laughing, cheering]\\nSo, if you know the Christmas Carol story, see if you can guess who of my guys should play whom in the movie.\\n[laughing]\\nYou guys ready for the little people in the boxes?\\n[audience cheering]\\n\\n\\n\\nThe first guy I\\u2019d like to introduce has been in my act a long time, and I\\u2019m fairly certain you can guess who he\\u2019d play in A Christmas Carol.\\nPlease help me welcome my old friend, Walter.\\n[audience cheering]\\nShut the hell up!\\nGood evening, Walter.\\nAnd why am I dressed like this?\\nI am hot as hell!\\nI know.\\nI think I\\u2019m having a stroke.\\nCome on.\\n[gargling sound]\\nI bet you love the holidays.\\nI bet you\\u2019re an idiot.\\nCome on. What\\u2019s your favorite Christmas carol?\\nMy favorite Christmas carol\\u2026\\nThat\\u2019s right.\\nYou mean one that makes me feel joy and hope and a beautiful peace inside?\\nThat\\u2019s right.\\n\\u201cGrandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer.\\u201d\\n[audience laughing]\\nThat\\u2019s not a Christmas carol.\\nJust imagining fills me with great joy.\\nWell, I\\u2019m happy to see you dressed for the occasion.\\nMe? I didn\\u2019t do this. You did this to me!\\nHe takes us on the tour bus and plays dolly freakin\\u2019 dress-up.\\nNo, I don\\u2019t.\\nNo one can hear us scream.\\nThat\\u2019s not true.\\nAh! He\\u2019s touching us again!\\nStop it. You look great for the occasion.\\nWhat occasion?\\nThis is our Christmas special, and this special is gonna be on Amazon Prime.\\nAmazon?\\nYeah.\\nOh, so they\\u2019re gonna deliver this special and leave it on everyone\\u2019s front porch?\\n[audience laughing]\\nInside another box that\\u2019s ten times the size it needs to be?\\n[audience laughing]\\nThen some jerk comes along and steals it off the porch, and I have to order it all over again?\\nYou know, Amazon makes things very convenient.\\nYeah, and how lazy have we gotten? I mean seriously.\\n\\u201cI need a, uh, a toothpick. I think they\\u2019re upstairs. Nah, that\\u2019s too far to walk.\\u201d\\n[audience laughing]\\n\\u201cI\\u2019ll just order it on Amazon.\\u201d\\nLet\\u2019s see. Two cents for a toothpick and 29 dollars for shipping. Done.\\n[audience laughing]\\nWalter\\u2026\\nThen, five minutes later it\\u2019s at my front door.\\nYeah.\\n\\u201cOh, look! They shipped me my toothpick in a box the size of a [bleep] Yugo.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience laughing]\\nA Yugo? That\\u2019s your reference?\\nI guess you\\u2019d prefer a Prius?\\n[audience laughing, cheering]\\nThat was a long time ago.\\nYou are forever damaged, my friend.\\nLook, our special\\u2019s gonna be on Amazon Prime, the subscription service.\\nOh, good, so we can subscribe, watch this special, then quickly unsubscribe so they won\\u2019t charge us.\\nThat\\u2019s not the best way to save money.\\nSays the guy who owned a Prius.\\n[audience laughing]\\nA blue Prius.\\n[audience laughing]\\nDoes your wife enjoy the holidays?\\nMy wife? You mean the nutcracker?\\n[audience laughing]\\nYour wife is a lovely lady, and I know that you love her very much.\\nWhatever.\\nTell everyone what you gave your wife last Christmas.\\nCOVID.\\nNo.\\n[audience laughing]\\nLook, next year there\\u2019s an idea of us filming a Christmas movie.\\nA movie?\\nYeah, I\\u2019m picking the best roles for all the guys.\\nOh, and that\\u2019s why I\\u2019m dressed like this?\\nYes.\\nSo I have to act?\\nEver done any acting?\\nSure.\\nLike what?\\nI laugh at your jokes.\\n[audience laughing]\\nThat\\u2019s not funny.\\nNo, not usually. They\\u2019re not.\\n[audience laughing]\\nWhat\\u2019s the movie?\\nA Christmas Carol.\\nAnd all of us are gonna be in it?\\nThat\\u2019s the plan.\\nAnd, uh, have you actually decided on who gets what role?\\nI\\u2019m working on that right now.\\nOkay, so you\\u2019re trying figure out who I should play?\\n[audience laughing]\\nWell, yeah.\\nSo, for me, you\\u2019ve narrowed it down to a few possible characters?\\n[audience laughing]\\nI\\u2019m a very versatile actor.\\nI\\u2019m sure.\\nI can even be that little kid who has a crutch.\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience laughing]\\nTiny Tim.\\nWhy are we suddenly talking about your\\u2026\\nOh! Oh! Oh! The kid! Tiny Tim!\\n[audience laughing]\\nI thought you were talking about your\\u2026\\nWalter\\u2026\\nTiny Tim.\\nWalter!\\nI\\u2019m sorry.\\nTiny Tim has a very important role.\\nI\\u2019m sure he does, Jeff. Good for you!\\n[audience laughing]\\nThis is a Christmas story.\\nGood place to hang the mistletoe. That\\u2019s all I\\u2019m saying.\\n[audience laughing]\\nWalter\\u2026\\nYou know, the twigs and berries.\\nWill you stop it?\\n[audience laughing]\\nOkay, back to the movie. Now, what\\u2019s that kid\\u2019s name?\\nIt\\u2019s Tiny Tim.\\nRight.\\nAnd I\\u2019m telling you\\u2026 with a little makeup, I could be that kid.\\nYou could be Tiny Tim?\\nHe\\u2019s angry, right?\\nNo.\\nOh, I think he is.\\nWhat is it he always says?\\nWell, his most famous line is, \\u201cGod\\u2026\\u201d\\nOh, yeah! \\u201cGod, why was I born? It\\u2019s a hard-knock life!\\u201d\\n[audience laughing]\\nWhat?\\nThen, he sings it, and the sun comes out tomorrow, and blahdy-blah-blah. I hate that stupid show.\\nThat\\u2019s Annie.\\nYeah.\\nAnd then Tiny Tim gets left alone at his house, and his mother yells, \\u201cKevin!\\u201d\\n[audience laughing]\\nThat\\u2019s Home Alone.\\nI could be Kevin, and you could be the guy that gets hit in the head with a box of tools and his hair catches on fire.\\n[audience laughing]\\nCan you act?\\nCan I act?\\nYou know, hang on a second.\\nWhat?\\nI don\\u2019t mean to interrupt here. I keep looking at you.\\nI don\\u2019t usually throw around compliments.\\nI just gotta say here, you know, you\\u2019re getting old, but you\\u2019re still looking pretty good.\\nDon\\u2019t you think so? He\\u2019s doing all right?\\n[audience cheering]\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you.\\nHa-ha. I\\u2019m [bleep] with ya. I\\u2019m acting.\\n[audience laughing]\\nOne of the most moving scenes in the story is near the end when Scrooge breaks down crying because he\\u2019s filled with regret. Do you think you could do that?\\nOh, sure. I\\u2019ll just pretend I\\u2019m your father.\\n[audience laughing]\\n[laughing]\\nWhat does that mean?\\nOh, come on. Think about you.\\nWhat?\\nYour father saved his entire life\\nto send his only son to a university.\\nYeah?\\nThen, you took your degree, did nothing with it, and ended up doing a puppet show.\\nHow much does that suck for your parents?\\nWalter\\u2026\\nI mean, look at what you\\u2019re doing now.\\nThis seems pretty good to me.\\nNo, not that. This.\\nWhat?\\nYou\\u2019re arguing.\\nYeah?\\nWith me!\\n[audience laughing]\\nRight.\\nWhich is actually you!\\nYou know what\\u2019s really weird?\\nWhat?\\nYou\\u2019re also losing this argument!\\n[audience laughing]\\nYou ever seen The Twilight Zone?\\nYou\\u2019re freaking in it!\\n[audience laughing]\\n[sings The Twilight Zone theme]\\n[audience laughing]\\nLet\\u2019s talk about your actual role in A Christmas Carol.\\nI don\\u2019t know who I would be.\\n[chuckling]\\nIt\\u2019s very obvious.\\nIt is?\\nYeah, you don\\u2019t even have to audition.\\nWhat?\\nThink about it.\\nWho do you look like?\\nUhh\\u2026\\nCome on.\\nGood God, you?\\nNo, not me!\\nWell, folks say you and I kind of look alike.\\nWell\\u2026\\n\\n\\n\\nCome on.

At least I can smile.\\n[audience ooh\\u2019s, laughs]\\nI can smile.\\nReally?\\nYeah, well, it hurts a little when I do.\\n[audience laughing]\\nLet\\u2019s see.\\n[audience laughing]\\nOh, I think I pulled a groin muscle.\\n[audience laughing]\\nAs for our movie, Walter, you would be Scrooge.\\nWhat? Me?\\nCome on. Ebenezer Scrooge was a very rich man who never got married.\\nOh, hell yeah. I\\u2019ll be that guy.\\n[audience laughing]\\nIn the beginning of the story, Scrooge is very lonely. Do you know why?\\nHe was a ventriloquist?\\n[audience laughing]\\nSorry.\\nIn the story,\\nScrooge gets woken up three times in the middle of the night.\\nAnd it gets worse and worse the older you get.\\n[audience laughing]\\nBack then, women were expected to marry, have children, and keep a nice household.\\nAnd those were the only acceptable roles for women during that era.\\nIs that too much to ask?\\n[audience laughing]\\nAre you trying to turn off every woman in this room?\\nOh, no, no. You\\u2019ve got that covered.\\n[audience laughing]\\nHey ladies, you wanna hear a sentence that in the history of humans no woman has ever said?

The material lacks the sharpness and rhythm that usually define her performances, leaving many of the jokes feeling more like filler than punchlines. Her critique of Dave Chappelle, while likely well-intentioned, detracts from the overall experience, coming off as more self-serving than impactful. The show struggles to find its footing, and what could have been a milestone performance instead leaves an impression of missed potential and underwhelming delivery.\\nMichelle Buteau\\u2019s comedy special, A Buteau-ful Mind at Radio City Music Hall, premiered on December 31, 2024, and is available for streaming on Netflix.\\n* * *\\n[woman] Don\\u2019t forget, brush your teeth.\\n[boy] Why do I have to brush my teeth?\\n[woman] Want your teeth to fall out?\\n[boy] Only one of them.

I need a publicist, an apology tour, I tried to get on Club Shay Shay. He was booked up. [audience laughing] Amanda Seales was about to do a three-part video on my ass. I had to watch High on the Hog seven more times. Ooh, baby! Can\\u2019t be light-skinned, fucking up Black culture. I won\\u2019t be invited to any of the fests. [scattered applause] But I\\u2019ve never seen over 10,000 tweets with my name, so I was like, \\u201cHow bad could it be?\\u201d [audience laughs] Well, there was an auntie who posted every hour on the hour, all in caps. I said, \\u201cOkay, consistency.\\u201d [chuckling] All in caps, she kept writing, \\u201cCALL THE COPS!\\u201d\\nWhat?\\n[crowd laughs] What? [scoffs] [chuckles] We ain\\u2019t gotta involve the police. [crowd laughs] Then a lot of people were like, \\u201cIs Michelle okay?\\u201d I said, \\u201cThank you so much.\\u201d [audience laughing] I don\\u2019t know, I really got to look in, you know? Check in on your strong friends. [chuckling] But the most, like, hilarious, yet hurtful comment that I do remember, somebody was just like, \\u201cDamn\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cSis looks like the housekeeper from Get Out.\\u201d [audience laughing] [imitating the housekeeper] No! No! [wailing] No! [wailing louder] No!\\n[screaming] No!\\n[audience laughing] No! [audience laughing] [Michelle sighs] I just realized how crazy that shit is for you if you\\u2019ve never seen Get Out. [audience laughs] Like, are you okay? [audience laughs] I\\u2019m just bad at internet. I don\\u2019t know how to not care. I either shut off or I just care too much. I thought the hardest conversations I would have with my children would be around racism, being bullied, sexism, but I\\u2019m realizing, I have to figure out how to have a proper conversation with my kids, to have them define their worth without likes and followers. [audience applauds] Yes, welcome to my big-titty TED Talk, bitches. [audience laughs] With dreams as big as her shoulder pads. [crowd laughing] And, you know, my kids are so smart. I\\u2019m hoping it won\\u2019t be hard. I have five-year-old twins.\\n[crowd cheers]\\nThank you. I have boy-girl twins until they tell me otherwise, \\u2019cause Mama is inclusive. [crowd cheers] Let\\u2019s love and evolve, mother\\u2026 They have the cutest names, I think. They have family names, Hazel and Otis. So cute. I got earrings with their initials. [audience laughs] [audience cheering] That\\u2019s right. She\\u2019s a ho for life. [audience laughs] [audience applauds] Oh my goodness. Ros\\u00e9, it\\u2019s so wet. [audience laughs] I didn\\u2019t realize, with twins, everybody wants to talk to you. I didn\\u2019t know that. People, like, walk up to me with agency and purpose. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cAre they twins?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cAre you a pediatrician?\\u201d [audience laughs] But usually it\\u2019s someone that\\u2019s always a twin, and wanna tell me they\\u2019re a twin. Like, \\u201cAre they twins? I\\u2019m a twin.\\u201d \\u201cI don\\u2019t like my twin. We share a birthday cake.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cThere\\u2019s a war going on.\\u201d [audience laughing] \\u201cWhat?\\u201d \\u201cWhat?\\u201d And they just stay. \\u201cYeah, my mom likes my twin better.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI see why.\\u201d [audience laughing] They keep talking. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI gotta stop you there.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m not friendly. I just have a double chin.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\n\\n\\n[Michelle chuckling] \\u201cI\\u2019m an asshole, it\\u2019s just ros\\u00e9 and butter. That\\u2019s all it is.\\u201d [crowd howling] Makes you very approachable. Gout is very approachable. [crowd titters] And I didn\\u2019t realize how different kids could be when they\\u2019re the same ingredient. They are so different. Like Hazel? Wow. Hazel has the energy of a 53-year-old Black woman that works at the DMV. [audience laughing] She is wild, she walks up in the playground, she\\u2019s like, \\u201cIs this what y\\u2019all meant to do?\\u201d [audience laughing] Hazelnut. The kids come up to me like, \\u201cMrs. Buteau, Hazel\\u2019s looking through my soul again.\\u201d [audience laughing] We got to do better. Oh my God. She\\u2019s sassy. I don\\u2019t know where she gets it from. [crowd laughs] Okay, you know what? I understand what you\\u2019re talkin\\u2019 about. However, I didn\\u2019t find my voice till I was in my 30s. She\\u2019s five. [crowd laughing] I was leaving the house one time in short sleeves to go food shopping, \\u2019cause that\\u2019s all I motherfucking do. [crowd laughing] And she said, \\u201cMama, you should put on long sleeves \\u2019cause your elbows look old.\\u201d [audience laughing] But here\\u2019s the thing, she ain\\u2019t wrong. My elbows look haunted as fuck. How? When? No one tells you about that in your 40s. It looks like I\\u2019ve been doing a plank for 22 years. [audience howling] How would I know my elbows look like the top of a pigeon\\u2019s head? When? Ladies, what all I need? Ashwagandha? What do I need? Magnesium? These elbows look crazy. My elbows look like the guy in the Indiana Jones movie, that chose the wrong cup. [audience laughing] Thank you, everybody over 38. Thank you. Thank you.\\nI see you.\\n[crowd applauds] [Michelle laughs] Oh my God, sassy children. And they don\\u2019t go to bed. They just are up all the time. She comes downstairs, 10:00 p.m. \\u201cMama, what you doing?\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cHiding my vape pen now. What\\u2019s good?\\u201d [audience laughing] \\u201cWhat\\u2019s up?\\u201d \\u201cYou already had two bananas. What all you need now?\\u201d [chuckles] [scoffing] My God. And sassy children, they go to bed late, they wake up early. She\\u2019s up 5:30 a.m. every day. I said, \\u201cGo back to bed, girl.\\u201d \\u201cYou ain\\u2019t missing anything.\\u201d [crowd chuckles] \\u201cThere is nothing going on right now.\\u201d \\u201cWe don\\u2019t live on a farm.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cThis is not the military.\\u201d \\u201cYou can go back to bed.\\u201d Oh my God. Hazel has so much energy. She is like\\u2026 Picture DJ Khaled as a five-year-old girl. [audience laughs] She wakes up in the morning, she\\u2019s like,\\n\\u201cGood morning, everybody!\\u201d\\n[air horn plays] [audience applauding] [audience continues applauding] [Michelle chuckles]\\n\\u266a All I do is twin, twin, twin! \\u266a\\n[air horn playing] She the best! Yeah! DJ Donwill, everybody. [audience cheers and applauds] [Michelle laughs] Oh my God. I can\\u2019t talk to Otis the way I talk to Hazel, \\u2019cause he\\u2019s so sweet and, like, quiet. Like, Hazel brings the Black mom out of me, but like a Black mom on Maury Povich. [audience laughing] Oh, baby. We be at Target, I\\u2019m like, [seething] \\u201cGet over here, girl.\\u201d \\u201cWe ain\\u2019t buying no more stuff. We ain\\u2019t buy\\u2026 Put it down!\\u201d [crowd laughs] She makes me feel like an angry ventriloquist. \\u201cGet over here!\\u201d \\u201cPut it down. I said no more stuff, we ain\\u2019t buying no more stuff.\\u201d [audience laughing] [Michelle chuckling] I can\\u2019t talk to Otis like that. Otis has the energy of a tired husband holding his wife\\u2019s purse at Macy\\u2019s. [crowd laughing] I see some of y\\u2019all in here tonight. Thank you so much. [audience chuckling] Otis is so sweet. He even blinks slow when he talks. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cMama\\u2026\\u201d [audience laughing] [audience continues laughing] [Michelle chuckles] I feel bad sometimes, because he\\u2019s growing up in a house with so much, like, strong female energy, but I\\u2019m also just like, \\u201cYou\\u2019re welcome.\\u201d [audience cheers] You know? \\u201cThat\\u2019s the best kind of education you won\\u2019t get in school.\\u201d [chuckling] I feel bad for him sometimes, his first complete sentence when he was three years old was, \\u201cOkay, everybody. Calm down.\\u201d [audience laughs] Otis! I\\u2019m trying to teach him how to be a big boy around the city, you know? Walking a New York City sidewalk, ride the subway, the train. Hold the door open for old people, all that shit. It\\u2019s important. And we were on a very crowded corner one time in New York City, and he yells in front of everybody, \\u201cMama, the blinking hand said we can\\u2019t go now!\\u201d I said, \\u201cThat\\u2019s right, baby.\\u201d And then strangers were just like, \\u201cGood job, Mama.\\u201d \\u201cGood job\\u2026\\u201d And parents know when your kid does something right in public, you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI am a fucking angel.\\u201d [audience laughing] \\u201cI am a walking angel. What are you childless fucks doing? Recycling? Okay.\\u201d \\u201cOkay.\\u201d \\u201cComposting? Okay.\\u201d We are leaving it better than how we found it. Otis caught wind, and he was very proud of himself. And so then he yells, \\u201cMama, the white man said we can go now!\\u201d\\n[audience laughing]\\n[audience continues laughing]\\nOh my God. So I call this story \\u201cBirth Control.\\u201d \\u2018Cause if you were thinking about having a kid, listen to this and decide. [crowd laughs] Otis had a big booger in his nose. A big booger and he\\u2019s like, \\u201cMama, how do I get this out?\\u201d Like, \\u201cThat\\u2019s a real question?\\u201d Know when your kid says something you\\u2019re like, \\u201cI\\u2019m worried for the rest of your life\\u201d? [crowd laughing] I said, \\u201cPut your finger in there, dig like you\\u2019re looking for an answer.\\u201d [audience chuckles] What am I, Mr. Rogers? I don\\u2019t know. He had a hard time getting it. I was like, \\u201cOtis, this is hard to watch.\\u201d [audience laughing] \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna be honest with ya.\\u201d His head was leaning back. Chasing himself like a dog chasing his tail. I was like, \\u201cThis is not how I want to remember you, you know?\\u201d [crowd laughs] He\\u2019s like, \\u201cMama, I can\\u2019t get it.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI see that.\\u201d I should also mention we were boarding a flight. [audience laughs] [Michelle chuckles] And he said, \\u201cMama, I can\\u2019t get it.\\u201d And so, I made a decision. I went in there and I got it. [crowd laughs] And then he did a move I\\u2019ve never seen a human body do. He folded like a beach chair. [crowd laughs] Laid out on the floor. He was like\\u2026 [squeaking sounds] And then laid. What? And lay down. And then he yelled\\u2026 [chuckling] \\u201cMama, I want to get my booger!\\u201d And then he says, \\u201cPut it back.\\u201d [audience laughs] And there were people behind me. And I had a decision to make. So I put it back. [audience laughing and groaning] [scattered applause] See, half y\\u2019all clap and half y\\u2019all judge, and I see that shit. Okay? That\\u2019s how people looked at me. I wanted to yell at them, like, \\u201cI used to be cool, okay?\\u201d \\u201cI was cool. I\\u2019ve done cocaine off of a dick, I know how complicated noses can be, bitch.\\u201d \\u201cEnjoy your overhead space.\\u201d\\n[scattered cheering and clapping]\\n[Michelle chuckling] It\\u2019s a good time to give my mom a shout-out in the audience.\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\nHi, Mom. Hi, Marie. [chuckles] Oh man, I must have been a sassy kid, \\u2019cause I feel her bone density be different. [crowd laughs] Like, I get it now, you know? I don\\u2019t like to complain, but I feel run-down, y\\u2019all. You know, like, don\\u2019t let the sequence and tulle fool you. [crowd laughs] I am run-down, like, if you come to my house, 5:30 every night, you can catch me on the couch, and I am serving Viola Davis tired. [audience laughs] [puffing and panting] [labored breathing] [imitating Viola Davis] \\u201cI\\u2019m so tired.\\u201d [fake crying] [gasps] [normal voice] So tired. Now I know why my mom looks like that. [audience chuckling] My mom looks like a husky dog in Miami, like\\u2026 I don\\u2019t know if she\\u2019s thirsty or smiling, it\\u2019s just\\u2026 [audience laughing] [panting heavily] [huffs] She always looks like she\\u2019s asking the question and answering it, like\\u2026 [audience laughing] [Michelle panting heavily] Now I get it. Now I get it. I feel like the door at the end of the movie Titanic.\\n[audience laughing]\\nJust, like, less buoyant, and everyone\\u2019s climbing on. My whole family is trying to take a seat. [crowd chuckling] And my whistle won\\u2019t work, I\\u2019m like\\u2026 [blows a raspberry] [keeps blowing a raspberry] [blows a raspberry harder] [blows a faint raspberry] [audience tittering] I get it! I get it. I didn\\u2019t even realize, like, you could hurt yourself when you\\u2019re taking care of kids, \\u2019cause you\\u2019re not thinking about how you move your body. And I hurt myself \\u2019cause I\\u2019m bending over all the time, and not in the way I like. Air horn! [air horn sound plays] [audience applauding] [chuckling] Thank you. I hurt myself real bad one time. And my husband was like, \\u201cI think you got sciatica.\\u201d And I didn\\u2019t even know what it was. That\\u2019s how young I was. [audience laughs] I thought it was an overpriced pasta. [audience laughs] He said, \\u201cI think it\\u2019s sciatica.\\u201d I said, \\u201cCheck the receipt. It\\u2019s Penne Pomodoro.\\u201d [audience laughs] That\\u2019s how young I was. Make some noise if you know what sciatica is.\\n[audience cheers]\\nYes! I love a grown crowd. Thanks for keeping your muscles in check. \\u201cI can\\u2019t come to the show tonight.\\u201d \\u201cMy sciatica is picking up right now.\\u201d Oh my God, I have readers now, what? I can\\u2019t see a menu. I\\u2019m that bitch. \\u201cTurn your light on.\\u201d [crowd laughs] \\u201cWhy are these restaurants so dark?\\u201d [audience laughs] I\\u2019m this old. [audience laughs] Oh my God, I hurt myself with the sciatica and I went to the doctor. He gave me athlete\\u2019s-grade ibuprofen. I was like, \\u201cYes, I am an athlete, good job.\\u201d [crowd chuckling] And he gave me a Theragun. Y\\u2019all know what a Theragun is? [cheers] Awesome. I didn\\u2019t know. I was like, \\u201cOkay, massage gun helping me out through the day.\\u201d \\u201cCome on.\\u201d And I couldn\\u2019t go nowhere, so I had a friend over and she happens to be a beautiful Black lesbian. I call her \\u201cThe Oracle.\\u201d [crowd laughing] She ever-knowing and glowing. And she saw my Theragun on my table and she goes, \\u201cOkay.\\u201d [audience laughs] I said, \\u201cGirl, that\\u2019s for my sciatica.\\u201d And she\\u2019s like, \\u201cWhatever.\\u201d [crowd howling] I said, \\u201cGirl, it\\u2019s my Theragun.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s got the word \\u2018gun\\u2019 in it.\\u201d And she said, \\u201cDepends where you point it.\\u201d [audience laughs] [Michelle chuckles] I said, \\u201cGirl.\\u201d She said, \\u201cGirl, what?\\u201d I said, \\u201cGirl, you stop.\\u201d She said, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d I looked at her, I said, \\u201cGirl.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\u201cYou like to get your pussy beat up like that?\\u201d [audience laughing] [woman] Woo!

You think you know somebody. Can I just recap what had happened right now? I told y\\u2019all a true-ass story about my beautiful Black lesbian friend. And a little bit of violence on a puss. Nothing crazy, a dollop will do you. [crowd laughs] And for the most part, we laughed. Some of y\\u2019all were judging. Some of y\\u2019all were curious. [audience laughs] You don\\u2019t see what I see. [audience laughing] [Michelle chuckles] But all I\\u2019m saying is it can be done. It can be done, we can tell jokes and stories and not disparage a whole community. We can do that. We can make it funny.\\nWe just have to work at it, right?\\n[applause]\\nSo if you ever run into Dave Chappelle, can you let him know that shit?\\n[audience cheers loudly]\\nI don\\u2019t think he know that shit. I don\\u2019t think we\\u2019ll run into Dave, \\u2019cause he\\u2019s the GOAT. And he is the GOAT, if that means going off about trans people. Dave. It\\u2019s not funny. It\\u2019s dangerous. Make it funny.\\n[audience cheering and applauding]\\n[Michelle] That\\u2019s all. I can\\u2019t believe somebody would make millions of dollars for making people feel unsafe.\\nThat is so wild to me, like\\u2026 Truly.\\n[crowd cheers]\\n[crowd cheers and claps]\\nI\\u2019m manifesting this shit tonight, this is a Radio City Music Hall takeover, and I\\u2019m gonna tell everybody, I wanna make millions and millions of dollars for making people feel safe, seen, secure, heard, and entertained. Entertained.\\nEntertaining.\\n[crowd cheers]\\nWhat are we doing? That is my goal. My goal used to be to find my belly button when I sit down, but that shit ain\\u2019t realistic. [crowd laughs] Girl, set yourself up for success. [audience laughs] Just have some goals. I just don\\u2019t know why people aren\\u2019t doing it anymore. You know? Say you do the thing, and then do the thing.\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\nThat\\u2019s all. Like my friends that are, like, stuck. Right? Always dating the wrong person. The way you do one thing is the way you do everything. Right? If you were in the theater tonight, dating somebody that\\u2019s not good for you, especially the ladies, don\\u2019t do it no more. Leave here tonight and unfollow that motherfucker.\\nThat\\u2019s energy you don\\u2019t have.\\n[audience applauds]\\nOkay? And I\\u2019m not a chiropractor, but you ain\\u2019t gonna be wet forever, sis. [audience laughs] God. It is a journey, though. You got to really, like, find the right one, you know? I\\u2019ve fucked a lot of frogs. [audience laughs] It was like a frog farm. [crowd laughing] I\\u2019m so glad I found the right one.\\nIt\\u2019s so nice.\\n[crowd applauds]\\nIt really is. When people meet me and my husband, they\\u2019re like, \\u201cWow, you guys like each other.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYou\\u2019re supposed to.\\u201d Why be with somebody you don\\u2019t like? That is what your family is for.\\n[audience laughing]\\n[Michelle chuckles] Hello? But I also think it\\u2019s important to, like, name the good time and name the bad times, that\\u2019s okay. The hardest time my husband and I had definitely was the pandemic. I didn\\u2019t get how social we were until we were together all\\u2026 the fucking time. [crowd laughs] I would move to another room, he\\u2019d follow me. I\\u2019ll be like, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s up?\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cWhat\\u2019s up?\\u201d His stories were terrible.

I started using this tone with him that I\\u2019d never used with anybody before. It\\u2019s like the tone you use when Alexa ain\\u2019t playing your song. [audience laughs] You know that tone? I was like, [yelling] \\u201cNo. I. Said\\u2026\\u201d [normal voice] What? Why am I talking to him like that? I love him. [woman howling] Name the good, name the bad. That\\u2019s how you get over it, celebrate it. Honestly, like, what I love about me and my husband is that we\\u2019re real partners, right? Like, we celebrate each other\\u2019s wins. And if you\\u2019re with someone who\\u2019s jealous of you, they don\\u2019t understand your power because they\\u2019re not in their power.\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\nOh my goodness. Look at me, shoulder pads. Dropping some wisdom. Where\\u2019s the donation basket? Come on, now. [audience laughs] [Michelle chuckles] Truly, we celebrate shit. I celebrate the small things. You got to, otherwise you have nothing to celebrate. I\\u2019ll pop a bottle of champagne on Wednesday \\u2019cause I paid a parking ticket. [crowd cheers] That\\u2019s how I\\u2019m living. That\\u2019s what I\\u2019m doing. Oh my God. And my husband threw me a party during the pandemic just for me. Because we found out Lenny Kravitz followed me on Instagram.\\n[audience cheering and applauding]\\n[cheering swells]\\n\\n\\n\\n[Michelle] What? What? Crazy, I came downstairs with streamers and balloons. My husband\\u2019s on the table, like, \\u266a American woman! \\u266a [audience laughing] I said, \\u201cI\\u2019m gonna suck it right off.\\u201d [audience applauding and cheering] [Michelle chuckles] [cheers subside] Happy for each other. But then Lenny Kravitz keep liking my posts. My husband went, \\u201cDo I got to worry about Lenny Kravitz?\\u201d [audience laughs] I said, \\u201cYes, you do.\\u201d [audience cheers] \\u201cYes, you do.\\u201d \\u201cNow clean them spoons, honey. I heard we ain\\u2019t got no clean spoons.\\u201d [audience laughs] Bitch. [laughter continues] My husband\\u2019s really into fixing stuff now.

He\\u2019s really good at being high. [audience laughs] It don\\u2019t matter how much or little he has, he\\u2019s like, \\u201cI\\u2019m cool, man.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m cool. Need help?

I want\\u2026 I want to serve, like, plus-size Erykah Badu, but\\u2026 [audience laughs] It ain\\u2019t, it\\u2019s serving plus-size crackhead, real talk. Ooh, baby, if you ever saw me in the street high, I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry, I\\u2019m high. Did you know I was high? Are my eyes red?\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m so sorry, I\\u2019m high!\\u201d [trilling] \\u201cWoo!\\u201d \\u201cIs it game night? What are we doing?\\u201d \\u201cFold laundry? Clean the fridge?

One night, I got tickets to the Knicks game, which is a basketball team. [audience cheering] That\\u2019s right, honey. We had courtside seats.\\n[crowd cheers]\\nYeah, he was very excited. I was like, \\u201cI\\u2019m good.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know about basketball.\\u201d He\\u2019s like, \\u201cIt\\u2019ll be fun.\\u201d I said, \\u201cYou should go with somebody.\\u201d He\\u2019s like, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s our date night.

Nothing\\u2026 Nothing crazy. I didn\\u2019t feel anything 40 minutes later, so I was like, \\u201cCan I have a little more?\\u201d [audience groaning] [audience laughing] Everybody knows but me! [crowd laughs] There\\u2019s no instructions on the side. [audience laughing] [Michelle] Woo! I\\u2019ll tell you what. We got to that game, I was holding on to my chair with two hands. [audience howling] [crowd continues laughing] \\u201cWow\\u2026\\u201d \\u201cWow\\u2026\\u201d\\n\\u201cWow.\\u201d\\n[crowd laughs] [softly] \\u201cWow.\\u201d Like, I don\\u2019t know if you guys have ever seen a kite with freckles and big hair. [audience laughing] That was me. [crowd laughs] Like, I didn\\u2019t know if I was talking to myself out loud, or if it was an inside voice. [crowd laughs] [hoarsely] She was out here. I was like, \\u201cWow.\\u201d\\nI was like, \\u266a Butterfly in the sky \\u266a\\n[audience cheers and laughs]\\n\\u266a I feel twice as high \\u266a\\n\\u266a Take a look \\u266a\\n[audience] \\u266a It\\u2019s in a book \\u266a \\u266a A Reading Rainbow \\u266a\\nYeah! [audience cheers and applauds]\\n[woman] Woo!\\nOh my goodness. I was nice, nice. [woman chuckles] And then the game started. [crowd laughs] [exhales] Then the paranoia set in. [audience laughs] The announcer was just so\\u2026 loud. [crowd laughing] I was shook, it felt like Cloverfield. I was like\\u2026 \\u201cWe got to go.\\u201d\\nHe was like\\u2026 [inaudible shouting]\\n[air horn sound plays] [audience laughing] Then the players came out, I was like, \\u201cWe are not safe.\\u201d [audience laughs] [laughing continues] They were so tall. [crowd laughs] It was all Adam\\u2019s apples and kneecaps. [audience laughing] They look like Sigourney Weaver as an Avatar. I was like, \\u201cNo.\\u201d [audience laughing] \\u201cNo, thank you.\\u201d I tried to get my husband\\u2019s attention like, [whispers] \\u201cBaby.\\u201d [straining] \\u201cBaby.\\u201d\\n[moaning] \\u201cBaby.\\u201d\\n[audience laughing] He\\u2019s like, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s up? Why you whispering?\\u201d I said, \\u201c\\u2018Cause the players can hear me.\\u201d [audience laughing] I said, \\u201cWe got to go.\\u201d He\\u2019s like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s been eight minutes.\\u201d [audience laughing] I said, \\u201cI\\u2019m really sorry, but we got to go.\\u201d \\u201cI am very high.\\u201d [audience laughs] And this is why I love my husband. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s okay, baby.\\u201d \\u201cJust enjoy it.\\u201d \\u201cJust enjoy the ride.\\u201d \\u201cRide the wave.\\u201d \\u201cTaste the rainbow.\\u201d [audience laughs] He\\u2019s like, \\u201cJust focus on something, and just like it.\\u201d \\u201cOkay?\\u201d All positive vibes. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cNo one can hear you.\\u201d \\u201cAnymore.\\u201d\\n[audience laughs]\\nAnd so, I actually did see a car\\u2026 in the corner of the court. And this car was beautiful, the lights were on. It was, like, going around in a circle. And I was like, \\u201cThat is really nice. Like\\u2026 \\u201d \\u201cI wonder who\\u2019s going to get it.\\u201d [crowd laughs] \\u201cWhere do they live? What kind of life will they have?\\u201d \\u201cAre they gonna put the Christmas tree on top?\\u201d Then I asked my husband, I was like, \\u201cBaby, when do we find out who wins the car?\\u201d [audience laughs] He was like, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d [audience laughing] I said, \\u201cWhen do we find out who wins the car?\\u201d And he goes, \\u201cBaby, no one\\u2019s going to win it.\\u201d And I was like, \\u201cWhat?\\u201d He\\u2019s like, \\u201cIt\\u2019s advertising, it\\u2019s not Family Feud, girl.\\u201d [audience laughing] And then I started to cry. [audience howling] I was like, \\u201cLife ain\\u2019t fair.\\u201d [crowd laughs] And then he\\u2019s like, \\u201cBaby, I think we should go.\\u201d I said, \\u201cI think we should go.\\u201d [audience laughing] But can I tell y\\u2019all, as soon as we both agreed we should go, they put me on the celeb cam. [audience laughs] I didn\\u2019t know what to do, so I was just serving, like, seventh-grade talent show. What?\\n[\\u201cEverybody Dance Now\\u201d plays]\\nTurn it up, turn it up!\\n\\u266a Give me the music \\u266a\\n\\u266a Everybody dance now \\u266a\\nThat\\u2019s good. Cut it, cut it, cut it.\\n[song stops]\\n[audience cheering]\\nHit it!\\n[\\u201cEverybody Dance Now\\u201d plays]\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\n\\u266a Everybody dance now \\u266a\\n\\u266a Yeah \\u266a\\n\\u266a Yeah \\u266a\\n[audience cheers]\\nKill it!\\n[audience roars]\\n[music fades] [audience applauds] [woman] Woo! [audience laughing] Hit it! [\\u201cEverybody Dance Now\\u201d playing] [song fades] [chuckles] Oh my God. I rea\\u2013 [laughing] Yo\\u2026 [laughing] [audience laughs] [audience cheering and applauding] I was like a Dominican Forrest Gump. Like\\u2026 [audience howling] I bachata\\u2019d my way out that fucking game. It was giving fight or flight realness. [crowd laughs] So\\u2026 about that story. [laughs] [crowd laughs] That\\u2019s the last time we did a date night. [audience laughs] And that\\u2019s okay, you know, I\\u2019m\\u2026 I\\u2019m a mom. I\\u2019m a working bitch. Like, I\\u2019m just tired, like\\u2026 You know, once I start hitting that Viola Davis like\\u2026 [panting and coughing] [crowd laughing] Give me the ros\\u00e9, put me to bed. So my husband and I have actually graduated to day dates. Is anybody that old? [crowd applauds] Responsible adult. Ooh, baby. Day dates are amazing. It\\u2019s exactly what it sounds like, a date during the day. Go to a restaurant you can\\u2019t get into Saturday night on Monday afternoon. [audience laughing] You got a prix fixe menu, you taste everything for $45. [audience laughs] [Michelle laughs] Have some wine. Go home in the afternoon, sit and spin on that dick. [audience laughing] Take a shower, get the hot spots, pick the kids up from school in a good-ass mood! [crowd laughing] Oh, I\\u2019m sorry, half of y\\u2019all picking your kids up smelling like badussy? [audience laughing] [audience chuckling] Okay. [Michelle laughs] My husband surprised me with this day date and\\u2026 [sighs] Yes, he is white, but this\\u2026 I don\\u2019t want to say this is about race, but this is the whitest shit I\\u2019ve ever heard. Who is white here, in the front? Thank you so much. What\\u2019s your name?\\nPearl.\\nPearl?\\nCome on.\\n[audience laughs] Pearl? Didn\\u2019t expect you\\u2019d have the whitest, oldest name. [audience laughs] I love your grandma. Okay, Pearl. You tell me if this is white as fuck. And you got be like, \\u201cThat is white as fuck.\\u201d Okay? My husband came home, and he said, \\u201cBaby, I got us two tickets to a reptile sanctuary.\\u201d [crowd laughs] Pearl.\\nThat\\u2019s white as fuck.\\nWhite as fuck. Thank you. [audience laughing and applauding] So I told him, I was like, \\u201cBaby, I can\\u2019t go to a reptile sanctuary.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s\\u2013 that\\u2019s crazy.\\u201d He\\u2019s like, \\u201cWe gotta go, the tickets were cheap.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cYou pay?\\u201d [audience laughing] \\u201cThey should be paying us.\\u201d [crowd chuckling] I looked at him, I was like, \\u201cAre you the reptile guy?\\u201d \\u201cI married the reptile guy?\\u201d He\\u2019s like, \\u201cThe reptile guy?\\u201d I said, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t know the reptile guy?\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s the guy whose, like, best friends are his lizards.\\u201d \\u201cHe lives with his mom for too long.\\u201d \\u201cDoesn\\u2019t have a comforter. Just got a dusty sheet, fucking monster.\\u201d [audience chucking] \\u201cHis favorite movie is Scarface. He\\u2019s got the poster.\\u201d \\u201cNo frame, just tacks? Yuck.\\u201d [audience laughing] \\u201cHe just got fired from Jiffy Lube, he\\u2019s got a pull-up bar so his door never closes.\\u201d [crowd chuckling] \\u201cAnd he never wears socks \\u2019cause they\\u2019re all crunchy around his fucking floor.\\u201d [audience laughs and groans] Don\\u2019t ask me how I know the reptile guy. This is what I\\u2019ve heard. My husband is just like, \\u201cI am not the reptile guy, but I really want to go.\\u201d And then he hit me with this European shit when he knows how to get me to do something. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cYou know, it just feels like Americans stop learning in school and then never want to learn.\\u201d [audience groaning] I was like, \\u201cHow dare you be so accurate?\\u201d [audience laughing] I was like, \\u201cFine. I will go look at lizards with you.\\u201d \\u201cBecause I love you.\\u201d And he goes, \\u201cYou know, it might be fun if we got a little high.\\u201d\\n[audience laughing]\\nSo I took an edible. But this time, I only took one. And it was wonderful. All you have to do is just wait two hours and 17 minutes. [crowd roaring] And it was great. I was in a good mood. Nothing was fazing me. I felt joyful. You know, I was, like, driving us to the reptile sanctuary in the Bronx in my minivan. I\\u2019m not proud of that sentence. [audience chuckling] In the Bronx, everyone\\u2019s got road rage. They\\u2019re, like, \\u201cMove over, bitch.\\u201d \\u201cLearn how to park.\\u201d Whatever, and I\\u2026 couldn\\u2019t even care\\u2026 Usually I would yell back, but I was just, like, \\u201cI hope you heal.\\u201d [audience laughing] I was like, \\u201cBeing high is wonderful.\\u201d I was in the pocket. I found parking. Or did it find us?\\n[audience laughing]\\n[Michelle] Woo! What I didn\\u2019t expect was this to be a tour. We were with other people. They were giving, \\u201cShoes optional at Walmart.\\u201d [audience laughing and groaning] You know? They were giving, like, third-generation January 6. [crowd chuckling and groaning] Yeah. You get it. You know, it was a lot of camouflage, but I see you. [audience laughing] [scattered applause] But I didn\\u2019t care. It was like Cowboy Carter. I was like, \\u201cThis is everyone\\u2019s America.\\u201d [crowd laughing] \\u201cThis ain\\u2019t Texas.\\u201d [Michelle chuckling] And it was pretty interesting. The most fascinating thing I learned about was a lizard called \\u201cthe bearded dragon.\\u201d [audience laughs] It wasn\\u2019t a dragon, it was more like a plus-size lizard, I called it Lizzo. [crowd laughing] I thought it was funny, people had mixed reactions. Just trying to be body-positive. Fascinating thing about the bearded dragon is that it can change its gender. And I was like, \\u201cOkay. We\\u2019ve all had a night like that or two.\\u201d\\n[Michelle chuckles]\\n[crowd laughs] Oh, well, at least I have. [audience laughing and whistling] Thank you. And when we walked into the bearded dragon sanctuary, which is again, a sentence I never thought I\\u2019d say, it came right up to me, and I was like, \\u201cOkay.\\u201d And put it\\u2019s, like, little paw on the window. I said, \\u201cOh, here we go.\\u201d Everyone\\u2019s like, \\u201cIt likes you.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI\\u2019m a Leo. I have good energy.\\u201d [audience laughing] We\\u2019re just taking our moment, and we\\u2019re sort of mimicking each other, becoming best friends. I was there so long, I felt like that white girl in that John Travolta movie, Boy in the Plastic Bubble. Do you remember that movie? No one remembers it. Please go home and check it out. John Travolta, in the \\u201970s, made a movie, Boy in the Plastic Bubble, where he has an autoimmune disease. So he has to live in a plastic bubble in his house. But he has shoes on. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhere you going, John?\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cWhere?\\u201d A lot of holes in that story, not in the plastic bubble, anyways\\u2026 So we\\u2019re just vibing, right? I\\u2019m like, \\u201cOh my God, this is amazing.\\u201d Then its eyes start to roll back. I was like, \\u201cGo off.\\u201d [crowd laughing] And then the lizard goes, \\u201cCome here.\\u201d\\n[audience laughing]\\n[audience continues laughing]\\n\\u201cYeah?\\u201d And it says, \\u201cKeep my wife\\u2019s name out your motherfucking mouth.\\u201d What? [audience roaring] They\\u2019re not even married! It was wild, and the tour guide was, like, so happy. He\\u2019s like, \\u201cShe never does this. She trusts you, she loves you.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cShe sure do, but honestly, right now, it\\u2019s giving they/them, okay?\\u201d [crowd laughing] Just being on the real, real. And then I heard a voice in the pack of camouflage, say\\u2026 \\u201cAh,\\u201d \\u201cYou one of them woke ones?\\u201d [crowd hooting] And so, you know, I\\u2019m a little high. [audience chuckling] And I go, \\u201cWhat did you say?\\u201d \\u201cI couldn\\u2019t hear through your four good teeth.\\u201d [audience laughing and applauding] \\u201cWhat?\\u201d \\u201cWhat?\\u201d And she goes, \\u201cI asked you if you were a woke bitch.\\u201d [crowd gasping] I look at my husband and I go, \\u201cDid she just call me a bitch?\\u201d And he goes like this\\u2026 [audience laughing] [laughter swells] And I said, \\u201cYeah, I, Tonya.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience laughs and groans]\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m one of them woke ones. What\\u2019s up?\\u201d I didn\\u2019t mean to poke the bear, but bitch, don\\u2019t come for me. Then she just started going off. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cThey/them. They trying to get us to say \\u2018they/them\\u2019 all the time.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cSis, you said it, like, seven times.\\u201d [audience laughing] \\u201cYou could do it. You just did. It\\u2019s fine.\\u201d \\u201cOr don\\u2019t, whatever.\\u201d I was like, \\u201cHonestly, if I can be married to someone named \\u2018Gijs\\u2019\\u2026 [crowd laughs] \\u2026you can say \\u2018they/them.'\\u201d [audience laughing] And then she said, \\u201cI am so tired of this bullshit phase, this non-binary, trans bullshit phase.\\u201d That\\u2019s what she said. I was like, \\u201cLook, I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s a phase.\\u201d \\u201cLike, walking down the street, living your truth as a non-binary or trans person, while you know somebody could want to hurt you or kill you is not a phase, that\\u2019s bravery.\\u201d\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\nI said, \\u201cYo.\\u201d \\u201cThem tattooed eyebrows on your face?\\u201d [crowd laughs] \\u201cThat\\u2019s a phase.\\u201d [audience laughs] \\u201cThat\\u2019s not a good one. You ain\\u2019t got no friends?\\u201d Then she just kept coming for me. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cAm I on Fox News?\\u201d \\u201cIs this a low-budget Laura Ingraham? What\\u2026\\u201d See why I don\\u2019t want to see lizards? See what I mean? She just kept going on and on. She\\u2019s like, \\u201cBut biology.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cSpell it.\\u201d [audience laughing] She\\u2019s like, \\u201cI don\\u2019t trust what\\u2019s between their legs.\\u201d \\u201cWhat\\u2019s between their legs? I don\\u2019t trust what\\u2019s between their legs.\\u201d I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhy do you give a shit what\\u2019s between someone\\u2019s legs?\\u201d \\u201cYou sound crazy. If you ain\\u2019t feeding, fucking, or financing, fuck off.\\u201d [audience cheers and applauds] [Michelle] \\u201cMa\\u2019am.\\u201d She just kept going in, and I just kept trying to answer her. I blacked out. I felt like a big-titty George Jefferson. [imitating George Jefferson] \\u201cAnother thing, motherfucker!\\u201d [normal voice] What am I\\u2026 What am I doing? [Michelle snickering] I\\u2019m in comfy shoes to see a lizard. [crowd chuckles] There was so much hate, and I was like, \\u201cYou\\u2019re very black-and-white with shit.\\u201d \\u201cI need you to live in the shades of gray where the love and humanity exists.\\u201d\\n[audience cheering and applauding]\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s what I need from you.\\u201d \\u201cI mean, a trans woman is no less of a woman, even if you don\\u2019t understand, okay?\\u201d \\u201cYou need to love that person. That is someone\\u2019s child.\\u201d [crowd applauds] \\u201cI have children. I have twins. My body couldn\\u2019t carry them.\\u201d \\u201cWe had a surrogate. I\\u2019m no less their mom.\\u201d \\u201cYou understand how love works?\\u201d \\u201cLike, just open your minds.\\u201d But she kept going on, and finally, I was like, \\u201cYou know what?\\u201d \\u201cI am too cute for this conversation.\\u201d I was a little high, now I\\u2019m a little sober, it\\u2019s okay. I said, \\u201cI\\u2019ll wear this outfit tomorrow \\u2019cause people need to see it.\\u201d I walk off. And then she yelled back at me, and she said, \\u201cAnd to think, I was gonna tell you that I loved your sweet potato casserole recipe!\\u201d [air horn plays] [audience cheering] Thank you, guys, so much for supporting me and being a part of history tonight.

My grandfather comes out,\\ngives her $20 and gave her a kiss.\\n[crowd awws] And then, he gave her another $20, gave her a longer kiss. Then he gave her another $20. Kind of a deeper, mouth-open kind of thing. Went up the back of the thing, snapped the fucking bra. Pulled the bra out, whipped it on the ground, got the hands rolling. The belt line, then got the hand in, went some buns. A little bun-smacking, went down the middle, finger tapping and shit. And then we were all like, \\u201cThis is fucked up,\\u201d uh, because it was my other grandfather.\\n[audience exclaims]\\nYeah. [chuckles] They used to flirt, but we didn\\u2019t know\\u2026 We didn\\u2019t see that coming. Uh\\u2026 [chuckles] Um\\u2026 Yeah, so I, uh\\u2026 my wife is younger than me.\\nAnybody have a younger wife here?\\n[man shouts]\\nYou do, right? You understand what I\\u2019m saying? My wife\\u2019s eight years younger than me. That was fine when we were young, because\\u2026 now that we\\u2019re older, she still looks good, I\\u2019m starting to look a little beaten. Know what I mean? And I don\\u2019t wanna\\u2026 I don\\u2019t want to do plastic surgery. I\\u2019ll never do that. I did try Botox\\u2026 on my dick. I Botoxed my dick. I wanted to make her\\u2026 a freshening-up, give her a better\\u2026 a younger-looking dick to slap around. I felt like\\u2026 I felt bad for her. My dick was starting to get a little\\u2026 a little worn-looking. You know, a little\\u2026 Almost like it needed a cane. It was always kind of leaning. Scoliosis dick. Kind of leaning on the right ball. My left ball was always like, \\u201cHow the fuck do I get left out?\\u201d My right ball was like, \\u201cShh, you\\u2019re gonna wake him.\\u201d \\u201cLet him rest. He\\u2019s tired.\\u201d\\nBut anyways, I Botoxed my dick. Fellas, I know you\\u2019re saying, \\u201cYou can do that?\\u201d Don\\u2019t do it. You\\u2019re better than that. You don\\u2019t need that shit. So I Botoxed mine. The problem is, it takes the wrinkles away. A flaccid penis needs wrinkles to show that it\\u2019s flaccid, you know? That\\u2019s why God gave you wrinkles for a reason. Pull your pants down, a girl sees. You go, \\u201cNo, it gets better than that.\\u201d \\u201cYou just gotta wait.\\u201d Anyways, I took the wrinkles away. I\\u2019m in the fucking, goddamn, uh, YMCA locker room. I\\u2019m naked.

Like it belongs on a third-grader.\\u201d I go, \\u201cThat\\u2019s \\u2019cause it\\u2019s not a fucking boner.\\u201d \\u201cThis is a normal fucking flaccid dick.\\u201d I said, \\u201cWould a boner face down?\\u201d They go, \\u201cYours does.\\u201d I said. \\u201cShut the fuck up, man.
